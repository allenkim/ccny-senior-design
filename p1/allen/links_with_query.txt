Bangor police detective’s blood alcohol content was 0.13, DA says — Bangor — Bangor Daily News — BDN MaineBANGOR, Maine — The Bangor police detective charged last week with drunken driving tested well above the legal limit for blood alcohol content, according to Penobscot County District Attorney R. Christopher Almy.
The last time a Bangor police officer was charged with drunken driving “was 25 years ago, in April 1987,” Conlow said.
Other Bangor police officers and Maine State Police troopers have faced drunken driving charges over the years that Almy’s office has prosecuted, the district attorney recalled.
“A person had given information that he had been drinking and they went and checked,” the district attorney said, referring to Tall’s fellow police officers.
Police used an Intoxilyzer test that showed Tall’s blood alcohol level was 0.13, Almy said.

Ignoring Torture Claims and Questionable Evidence, New York Jury Convicts Pakistani Scientist Aafia SiddiquiBack in 2003, Aafia Siddiqui was wanted by law enforcement and the FBI and suspected of links to al-Qaeda leadership.
I think Aafia Siddiqui was likely in a number of secret prisons in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, before she came to be in US custody.
She wrote about Aafia Siddiqui in the November issue of Harper’s Magazine, the piece called "The Intelligence Factory: How America Makes Its Enemies Disappear."
Aafia Siddiqui was not tried on terrorism charges or for her alleged ties to al-Qaeda.

Elma man was electrocuted through downed power wire, not urineTurns out that the Grays Harbor County man was killed by touching a downed power line last weekend, electrocuted through his hand and not through his urine stream as first suspected.
Well, let's put the story of Roy Messenger in the category of "sometimes it's best to await the autopsy results."
When relatives found him dead it appeared that he had urinated on the downed wire.
Chief Deputy Dave Pimentel said the results Wednesday showed 50-year-old Roy Messenger touched the wire with his left hand and the current shot through his body to his feet.
Messenger had collided with a power pole Friday night, knocking down the wire, and had called relatives to help pull is car out of the ditch.

By Michael J. Murphy03 March, 2010Countercurrents.orgWhat would you say if you were told that airplanes were regularly spraying toxic aerosols in the skies above every major region of the world?
When these scientists were asked about the possibility of existing aerosol programs; they stated that no aerosol spraying programs have been implemented to date.
As a matter of fact, Oliveira stated that witnesses from around the globe claim that heavy aerosol spraying is occurring almost every day over just about every city.
Ironically, these are the same substances the scientists are considering implementing in the various potential “future” aerosol spraying campaigns that were being discussed at the meeting.

Fast food workers in New York City earn just below $9.00 an hour on average, and rarely receive health care, paid sick days or other benefits that make it possible to live in an expensive urban center like New York City.
From the Chicago teachers’ strike to WalMart walkouts to protests at fast food restaurants across New York City, 2012 is shaping up to be the year that labor fought back.
By seven and eight o’clock, workers refused to assume their shifts at fast food restaurants across Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
The fast food campaign is the latest in a wave of low wage worker protests in New York.

Dollar-Less Iranians Discover Virtual CurrencyYet there’s one currency in Iran that has kept its value and can be used to purchase goods from abroad: bitcoins, the online-only currency.
The advantage for Iranians is that bitcoins can be swapped for dollars that can then be kept outside the country.
Merchants around the world accept the currency, from a bakery in San Francisco to a dentist in Finland.
Created in 2009 by a mysterious programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoins behave a lot like any currency.
For now, Iranians are using bitcoins to maintain a fragile connection to the outside world.

The bill that can turn the Internet into an anti-piracy spying machine was widely protested online and in Washington.
“CISPA is a dangerous piece of legislation and it’s worrisome that the House has passed such an overreaching bill,” said Free Press Action Fund Policy Director Matt Wood.
Over a million people signed petitions urging their representatives not to pass the bill, but without success.
“The bill still lacks effective oversight and accountability for companies and government agencies collecting massive amounts of our personal data.

Another oil sheen found near site of 2010 oil spill in Gulf of Mexico - XinhuaHOUSTON, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- Another oil sheen has been reported in the Gulf of Mexico near the site of the 2010 BP oil spill, the U.S. Coast Guard said Thursday.
An earlier sheen was reported on Sept. 16 in waters near the site of the 2010 spill.
The 2010 blowout of BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico triggered an explosion that killed 11 rig workers and unleashed the worst oil spill in the U.S. history.
A cap and plug were successfully put in place and no further oil emissions from the containment dome have been observed, the Coast Guard said.
Robotic cameras will be used starting Dec. 3 to determine the source of the new sheen, according to the report.

Obama Mulls Sanctions on Israel“The Obama administration is against sanctions on Iran, but for them on Israel,” said Noah Pollak, executive director of the pro-Israel organization Emergency Committee for Israel.
The possibility of sanctioning Israel for its ongoing construction sends a signal that the Obama administration is willing to go further in its denunciations of Israel than any previous White House.
BY: Follow @Kredo0The Obama administration is refusing to discuss reports that emerged early Thursday claiming that the White House is considering imposing sanctions on Israel for continuing construction on Jewish homes in Jerusalem.
At the same time, the White House is vigorously pushing Congress against passing new sanctions on Iran.
One senior congressional aide who works on the issue of Israel expressed shock that a White House could even discuss such action.

The awkward revelation on Tuesday came at the worst possible moment for Germany's defense ministry.
According to the confidential report that was leaked on Tuesday, the German NATO task force would face serious problems if it had to intervene abroad.
On Tuesday, German broadcaster ARD revealed that German soldiers tried to hide the lack of arms by replacing heavy machine guns with broomsticks during a NATO exercise last year.
The lack of equipment does not come as a surprise to close observers of the German army.

In terms of buying power, the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968, when it was nominally $1.60 an hour.

So in compiling the evidence on diet and health, the group took a different tack from previous committees.
A new report by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, says that the rest of the American diet is having devastating effects: about two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese.
[U.S. government: Cholesterol isn't as bad as we thought]"Available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and [blood] cholesterol," the report found.
The government has published dietary guidelines since 1977, and during that time, those guidelines did not avert what many nutritionists consider a dietary disaster -- the nation slipped into an obesity epidemic.

Whoever flew the unmanned aircraft over the Testalinden Creek fire is "irresponsible and selfish in my mind," said drone operator and instructor Sterling Cripps.
Helicopters fighting a wildfire near Oliver, B.C., were grounded because a drone was flying in the area.
People have been taking to the skies in increasing numbers now that recreational drones are more affordable than ever.
The Testalinden Creek fire, near Oliver, B.C., has quickly grown to over 1,500 hectares, or more than 10 times the size of Vancouver's Stanley Park.

Two former Ga. police officers charged with murder for stun gun death of handcuffed manThe officers handcuffed him and used a stun gun to prod him and keep him moving forward, the attorney said.
Weems wrote in his report that he used his stun gun at least three times on Towns.
Then, later on Tuesday, a judge in New Mexico ruled that two officers will face trial on murder charges for the 2014 shooting death of James Boyd, a homeless man.
While the death was being investigated, Eberhart resigned and Weems was fired by the department, which has a policy prohibiting officers from using stun guns.

How older workers can navigate today's job marketIncreasingly, some jobs experts say, older workers in the job market are so common that they no longer stick out.
To be sure, older workers do still take longer to get back into the workforce after a job loss than their younger counterparts.
And even anecdotally, older job seekers say, it's tough out there.
"Older workers can offer real-world experiences that they can translate, rather than just hypotheticals" in an interview, something hiring managers are clamoring for today, he said.

Since the spill occurred, daily North Slope production has dropped about 10,000 barrels per day, from 533,000 to 521,000, according to state tracking data.
JUNEAU Work crews for BP Plc were clearing contaminated snow on Thursday on Alaska's North Slope after a Prudhoe Bay well line ruptured, spraying a 34-acre area with crude oil and natural gas.
Just how much liquid escaped from the line remains under investigation by BP and Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation.
The leak comes nearly eight years after BP had to order Prudhoe operations to be partially shut down when a transit line leak discharged about 200,000 gallons of oil.

Each club is allowed up to 45 members and the cultivation of up to 99 marijuana plants.
It will be interesting to see how many growers are ultimately authorized in the future.

A Nepalese Worker Dies Every Other Day in QatarThe Guardian believes that if these figures were included, the death toll would “almost certainly” be more than one a day.
The Guardian reports that Nepalese migrants building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar died at a rate of one in every two days during 2014.
The death toll excludes deaths among Indian, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi workers.
Human rights organizations have accused Qatar on falling behind on the investigations and labor reforms they vowed to implement following a report by international law firm DLA Piper published in May.
The Nepalese foreign employment board told the newspaper that 67 of its nationals had died of cardiac arrest and 8 of heart attacks, while 34 death were logged as workplace accidents.

Man's pardon withdrawn after Times discloses financial regulators' censureThe governor's office typically sends pardon applications to the Board of Parole Hearings for investigation, and the findings are returned to the governor's office for a decision.
That changed later Wednesday afternoon when The Times informed the governor's office that federal records show Carnes was disciplined by investment regulators in May 2013.
The majority of those granted pardons, however, committed drug-related offenses that are no longer felonies in California.
In the Christmas Eve pardon, Brown said Carnes had "paid his debt to society and earned a full and unconditional pardon."
Another man who received a pardon called the vetting by the governor's office "exhausting."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-move-closer-to-taxing-you-by-how-far-you-drive/
States move closer to taxing you by how far you driveWith gas tax revenues falling, at least 18 states have given some consideration to taxing motorists by how far they drive.
Let's say the owner of a low-MPG pickup or large SUV is paying a per-mile tax rather than a gas tax.
A major roadblock to adopting a per-mile tax is the specter of mandatory tracking of all citizens with GPS-like devices.
"Raising the gas tax would be a faster, more cost-effective and equitable way to increase tax revenue," Brauer said.
In addition, the spread of all-electric cars and gas-electric hybrids has further lowered gas tax revenues.

Denver shelters say legal marijuana attracting more homeless to cityThe city is eager to see the results of a study by Metropolitan State University of Denver's Criminal Justice and Criminology Department of issues related to legal marijuana, including any correlation between legal marijuana and rates of homelessness.
About a third of this year's newcomers cited legal weed as a factor in moving to Colorado, said Kim Easton, the director.
So he moved to Denver, where legal pot dispensaries are plentiful and accessible.
Not all of them are pot-smokers, Luehrs said, but many have said they were drawn to the state because of legal marijuana.
Colorado's homeless population and its marijuana dispensaries are both concentrated in Denver, which could be why centers say they are experiencing a more noticeable rise.

The Huffington Post: Israeli-Occupied TerritoryIt is especially unsurprising in the case of the Huffington Post, which founder Arianna Huffington touts as a “people’s media” in which “truth” is the highest value.
“Shame on Huffington Post for its disgusting lack of integrity.”Shame?
The “mainstream” televised and dead-tree-media has historically been a reliable “reporter” of the merits of the Israeli case.
What’s so galling is that the Huffington Post poses as an “alternative” media outlet, the virtual embodiment of the new online populism that gave rise to the blogosphere.
There’s a ready explanation of why, as the Israelis pound Gaza, the formerly antiwar Huffington Post has become a cheerleader for the IDF: it is due entirely to this.

Feds, Mormons denied radiation sickness downwind of 1950s Nevada nuclear tests [audio 29min]8-14-06Feds, Mormons denied radiation sickness downwind of 1950s Nevada nuclear tests [audio 29min]In the early 1950s, life was peaceful in the almost exclusively Mormon community in the small town of St. George, Utah.
St. George and its people were the victims of radioactive dust, drifting over from atmospheric atomic tests, carried out in the Nevada desert.
Only in recent years has the government acknowledged weapons testing as the likely cause of killing or sickening civilians downwind.
The Justice Department started a compensation program that requires victims to prove they have a qualifying type of cancer and that they were residents of counties in southern Utah, Nevada, or Arizona.

The doctors only agreed to talk to New Times after Tarby was approached with a copy of the fumarase deficiency study.
There is no doubt in the mind of any expert interviewed by New Times that the practice of polygamy combined with inbreeding has fostered the spread of fumarase deficiency.

Study: Diamonds link comet to mammal extinctionDiamonds found in North American soil suggest a comet led to the extinction of dozens of mammal species.
(CNN) -- Tiny diamonds found in the soil are "strong evidence" a comet exploded on or above North America nearly 13,000 years ago, leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species, according to a study.
The study was conducted by a group of eight archaeologists and geologists from the universities of Oregon and California, Northern Arizona University, Oklahoma University and DePaul University.
"A rare swarm" of comets rained over North America about 12,900 years ago, sparking fires that produced choking, leading "to the extinction of a large range of animals, including mammoths, across North America," the report said.
"These discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants, animals and humans across North America."

A damaged hip joint, which causes persistent pain and makes everyday activities harder to perform, needs to be replaced.
Hip joints are made up of bones that are connected by tough tissues, called ligaments, and strong muscles which hold the hip joint together and prevent it from becoming dislocated.
The ball and socket joint, more commonly known as the hip joint, is one of the largest joints in the human body.
Hip joint replacement is done through surgery, a medical practice which began in the 1960s.

Who’s the Dog Hero of the Raid on Bin Laden?Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of United States forces in Afghanistan, said last year that the military needed more dogs.
Even its breed is the subject of great interest, although it was most likely a German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois, military sources say.
Another use may have been to catch anyone escaping the compound in the first moments of the raid.
But its use in the raid reflects the military’s growing dependence on dogs in wars in which improvised explosive devices have caused two-thirds of all casualties.
“Dogs can be very intimidating in that situation.”Sergeant Mylott said that dogs got people’s attention in ways that weapons sometimes did not.

He says the arson squad believes an electrical fault in an appliance inside the family's tent sparked the fire.
Sixteen year-old Ben Spies died yesterday morning while Brett Spies and his daughter Georgie survived the blast at the Timbertop Caravan Park but died in hospital overnight.
The Commissioner says a coronial inquiry will be held into the deaths of 48 year-old Brett Spies and his two teenage children, Ben and Georgie, at the Timbertop caravan park yesterday.

Mr Panetta also told the network that the US Navy Seals, rather than Mr Obama, made the final decision to kill bin Laden.
And by the time they got to the third floor and found bin Laden, I think it - this was all split-second action on the part of the Seals."
Lieutenant General Asad Durrani, former head of the ISI, Pakistan's intelligence service, said it was "inconceivable" that his government was unaware of the US raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.
The ISI's official line has been that bin Laden's compound had "slipped off our radar" after it raided the building in 2003 while hunting for another senior al-Qaeda operative.The agency claims it was unaware that bin Laden was hiding there.

Strauss-Kahn, 66, is among more than a dozen other defendants, including hotel managers, entrepreneurs, a lawyer and a police chief.
The former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a French court that he participated in sex parties reminiscent of orgies in antiquity because he needed “recreational sessions” while he was busy “saving the world” from one of its worst financial crises.

New Service Offers Taxis Exclusively for WomenA new livery service starting Sept. 16 in New York City, Westchester County and Long Island will offer female drivers exclusively, for female riders, according to its founder.
“We can recruit more women and provide better service to the community,” said Jose Viloria, the owner of Elegante car service, where currently only 10 of the 350 drivers are women.
SheTaxis, which has a staff of six, has already recruited 50 female drivers, ranging in age from 21 to 70.
Ms. Mateo’s husband, Fernando, is the founder of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, an industry group representing 30,000 taxi and livery drivers.
At a recent lunch in Manhattan, more than a dozen livery company owners and their representatives welcomed the women drivers, with several noting that women tended to be their best employees.

Court Rejects Plan to Clearcut California Redwoods for Vineyard: Press Release# # #Friends of the Gualala River is a volunteer nonprofit group that advocates for preservation of the Gualala River watershed in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties.
In response, Judge Daum said the state’s “environmental impact report” for Artesa Winery’s forest-to-vineyard project violates the California Environmental Quality Act.
The judge also agreed with the conservation groups that the environmental report wrongly ignored California Board of Forestry policy regarding forest conversions.
The proposal in northwestern Sonoma County was challenged by the Sierra Club’s Redwood Chapter, the Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Gualala River.
The board is charged with overseeing forest policy in California and opposes the conversion of prime timberland, like the project site.

Obama White House offering 30-year eagle-killing permits in plan to boost windmill industryIt’s unclear what toll, if any, wind energy companies are having on eagle populations locally or regionally.
“This is not a program to kill eagles,” said John Anderson, the director of siting policy at the American Wind Energy Association.
Gunshots, electrocutions and poisonings almost certainly kill more bald and golden eagles than wind farms.
The White House has championed wind power, a pollution-free energy intended to ease global warming, as a cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s energy plan.
No wind energy company has obtained permission authorizing the killing, injuring or harassment of eagles, although five-year permits have been available since 2009.

The troops are assisting local police with security patrols of five neighborhoods that have been evacuated because they are in the lava's path, said Maj. Jeff Hickman of the Hawaii National Guard.
The slowly moving strip of lava was about 480 feet from Pahoa Village Road, the town's main street, Civil Defense Administrator Darryl Oliveira said at a morning news conference.
The lava has crept slowly toward the rural village, incinerating parts of a cemetery and a shed this week.
It has not yet reached a dirt embankment one property owner had built around his lot, he said.

Iranian Website Pulls Interview With U.S. State Department OfficialThe online publication of an interview with the U.S. State Department's Persian spokesman by a conservative Iranian website appears to have been pulled following official criticism and condemnation.
A U.S. official told RFE/RL that government policy was to try and engage the Iranian people through Eyre and other avenues, and that the State Department hoped the interview with Alef would eventually be published in its entirety.
Iran's Culture Ministry said in a statement on April 4 that there was no justification for the Alef website to allow what it called a U.S. "intelligence officer" the opportunity to respond to questions from Iranians.
Rajanews said Alef failed to give its readers any background about "the enmity of the U.S. government toward the Iranian nation and the Islamic Revolution."
Eyre had earlier confirmed to RFE/RL by e-mail that he was set to be an online guest on Alef.

House Republicans Push False Choice To Justify Jacking Up Student Loan Interest RatesHouse Republicans Push False Choice To Justify Jacking Up Student Loan Interest RatesBy Pat GarofaloUnless Congress acts, the interest rate on federal student loans will double this summer from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.
“Tackling the challenge of the Stafford loan interest rate increase will require tough choices.”This is, quite simply, a false choice.
“We’ve seen massive state divestment from education,” explained Rich Williams, higher education advocate at US Public Interest Research Group.
There is nothing preventing Congress from finding the money to prevent the interest rate increase from anywhere in the federal budget.
The Obama administration has called for Congress to prevent the increase and Senate Democrats are looking to move a bill doing just that through the upper chamber.

The U.S. holds more prisoners in solitary confinement than any other country in the world, Amnesty said.
In letters to The Republic, inmates have raised concerns similar to those in the Amnesty report.
Improve mental-health monitoring; take steps to reduce suicide, including more humane conditions in suicide watch cells; and prohibit solitary confinement of prisoners under 18.

Florida head of crime tips program refuses to turn tip over to judge"The issue is the court asking Crime Stoppers to go back on their promise," Masten told the judge.
Crime Stoppers programs are operated on both a local and national level, allowing community members to provide anonymous information about criminal activity without fear of prosecution or revenge.
But Masten said he would not allow a judge to review the information and decide whether it compromised the tipster's identity.
The lawyer for the defendant had asked the judge to review the information, saying it could be necessary for their case.
The judge stayed Masten's sentence until next week to allow him more time to consider turning over the information.

Foes of America in Russia Crave Rupture in TiesBuilding a Eurasian economic bloc, including Ukraine, became a central goal for Mr. Putin upon his return to the presidency.
Mr. Prokhanov, for one, was flush with victory.
His point man on the project was the economist Sergei Glazyev, an associate of Mr. Prokhanov’s and Mr. Dugin’s.
“Confrontation with the West is welcomed by all too many here, to cleanse the elite, to organize the nation.”When he took power in Russia, Mr. Putin seemed intent on balancing the voices of strong-state nationalists and promarket liberals, among them the tycoons entrusted with Russia’s corporate empires.
His dingy office and tiny, extremist newspaper belie ties to Russia’s security services, which have long employed “agitators” to whip up support for their initiatives.

Denmark: 'Free' supermarket swaps food for reviewsCopenhagen's first "free" supermarket is scheduled to open in a few days, The Copenhagen Post reports.
The concept isn't unique to Denmark, but has been gaining popularity as companies try to harness the power of customer reviews online.
"'Tryvertising' is an innovative way to reach them."
Once customers register online with Freemarket, they place an order and pick everything up at the shop.
Freemarket also charges 19 kroner (£2.02; $3.40) a month to pay for the "physical operation" and has a monthly limit of 10 products.

He argues that current investments in renewable energies to combat the threat of global warming will make it harder to secure energy in a colder climate.
"Tony Abbott needs to repudiate these views and dump Mr Newman from his business advisory council," he said in a statement.

Bank Bailout Reaches $3.7 TrillionThe total includes Federal Reserve programs and a myriad of asset guarantees, including Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protection for bank deposits.
David LawderReutersWASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) – Increased housing commitments swelled U.S. taxpayers’ total support for the financial system by $700 billion in the past year to around $3.7 trillion, a government watchdog said on Wednesday.
“Indeed, the current outstanding balance of overall Federal support for the nation’s financial system…has actually increased more than 23% over the past year, from approximately $3.0 trillion to $3.7 trillion — the equivalent of a fully deployed TARP program — largely without congressional action, even as the banking crisis has, by most measures, abated from its most acute phases,” the TARP inspector general, Neil Barofsky, wrote in the report.
The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program said the increase was due largely to the government’s pledges to supply capital to Fannie Mae ( FNMA.OB ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ) and to guarantee more mortgages to the support the housing marketIncreased guarantees for loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Government National Mortgage Association and the Veterans administration increased the government’s commitments by $512.4 billion alone in the year to June 30, according to the report.

Investigators said BP did not disclose the matter to the appropriate federal agency and failed to suspend drilling operations until the problem was resolved, as required by law.

The damaged pipes released thousands of gallons of oil, which flowed into the nearby harbor and the Yellow Sea.
Five days ago, in the northeastern port city of Dalian, China, two oil pipelines exploded, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air and burning for over 15 hours, destroying several structures - the cause of the explosion is under investigation.
The oil slick has now grown to at least 430 square kilometers (165 sq mi), forcing beaches and port facilities to close while government workers and local fishermen work to contain and clean up the spill.

He demanded an investigation into the shootings of zoo animals.
The head of the Tbilisi Zoo pleaded Monday with city officials and residents not to kill any wild animals that may still be at large after dozens escaped in the aftermath of Sunday’s devastating flood.
Among the animals that fled the flooded zoo were lions, tigers, bears, wolves, a hippopotamus and one jaguar.

Connecticut gun controls estimated to have cut fatal shootings by 40%Studying the impact of gun control laws in the US is notoriously challenging.
In this analysis, the rate of gun homicides dropped by 40 percent.
So, for example, neighboring Rhode Island accounts for about 70 percent of the synthetic state's composition, Maryland another 15 percent.
For homicides from all causes other than guns, the synthetic state tracked Connecticut both before and after the passage of the 1995 gun control law.
A variety of demographic factors influence the prevalence of lethal violence, and it's difficult to find states that share all these factors and differ in terms of gun laws.

US Department of Energy funding for nuclear R&DAbout $31 million is being awarded to 43 university-led nuclear energy research and development projects through the Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP).
Sixty-eight projects have been selected to share over $60 million of US Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear energy research and infrastructure enhancement awards.
"These awards provide essential funding for nuclear energy-related research and thereby support the long term health of our domestic nuclear energy industry," he said.
Announcing the funding, US Energy Secretary said he remained "convinced" of nuclear energy's ongoing role as a carbon-free contributor to the USA's energy portfolio.
The areas covered by the R&D awards include fuel cycle research and development, reactor concepts research development and demonstration, and nuclear energy advanced modelling and simulation, as well as supporting functions such as cyber security.

Bird flu prompts first shipment of EU eggs to US in decadesLast month, the agency predicted a dozen eggs would cost $1.33 to $1.45 in the fourth quarter.
Egg markets face disruption across Europe as the US seeks to replace supplies lost from outbreaks of bird flu, traders have warned.
One estimate suggested about 1% of its output – equivalent to 100m eggs – could be shipped to the US.
Still, total supplies are expected to drop 4 percent from last year to 8.1 billion dozen, according to the agency.
The USDA pegged 2015 egg imports at 41.4 million dozen, up 32 percent from its May forecast and 26 percent above 2014 imports.

In his judgment, Mr Justice Hardiman said the second extradition attempt was an abuse of process.
He was later charged with negligent driving causing death and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by a Hungarian court.
The Supreme Court, by a three/two majority, allowed his appeal against that decision yesterday.

CIA secretly operates on Syrian border, supplies arms to rebels — RT NewsAmerican secret service operatives are distributing illegal assault rifles, anti-tank rocket launchers and other ammunition to Syrian opposition, the New York Times reports.
While, it seems, supplying Syrian opposition with arms, the US would like to see Syria’s allies, Russia in the first place, stop supplying weapons to the regime of President Bashar Assad.
The State Department has reportedly allocated $15 million in medical supplies and communication equipment for armed opposition groups in Syria.
According to the source, CIA operatives might be helping the rebels with organizing a rudimentary intelligence organization.
The NYT source, an unnamed Arab intelligence official, revealed that American officers are also collecting information on Syrian opposition groups and recruiting informants among their ranks.

US city plans moat to keep out migrantsThe moat plan has won broad local backing, unlike other border security schemes which have angered environmentalists and land-owners.
"What you are building is a moat, but it's bringing the life and the wildlife back," said Ogden.
Now the latest initiative by the US to seal its increasingly porous border with Mexico harks back to one of the oldest approaches: dig a moat.
Yuma county sheriff Ralph Ogden, quoted in the article above, spoke to the Reuters news agency and not to Associated Press.
The scheme would see engineers dig out a two-mile stretch of a 180-hectare (440-acre) wetland known as Hunters Hole.

For the next four years he was held captive, moved from country to country and suffered, he says, appalling torture.
It was during the searches for hidden weapons that, Mr al-Maqtari claims, British troops became involved.
During his incarceration Mr al-Maqtari was moved from Baghdad to a prison near Kabul in Afghanistan and later in Yemen.

Snowden disclosures prompt warning on widely used computer security formula"If vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible," NIST said on September 10.
SAN FRANCISCO In the latest fallout from Edward Snowden's intelligence disclosures, a major U.S. computer security company warned thousands of customers on Thursday to stop using software that relies on a weak mathematical formula developed by the National Security Agency.
Developers who used RSA's "BSAFE" kit wrote code for Web browsers, other software, and hardware components to increase their security.
But after the Times report, NIST said it was inviting public comments as it re-evaluated the formula.
The NSA-promoted formula was odd enough that some experts speculated for years that it was flawed by design.

"The 800-kilogram black cow is very strong because its cell donor was the best available.
In 2009, Park cloned the black cow from a frozen cell, which was taken from a deceased animal as part of cloning work to technically "revive" the dead cow through the newly born clone.
The video clips were for reports to officials at the agricultural ministry slated for later this month as the technology for cloning the black cow species is new.
Against this backdrop, Park and his team relied on their knowhow of the freeze-and-thaw process to extract stem cell lines from cloned human embryos.

Swiss Vote to Keep Mandatory Army ServiceIn 1989, Swiss voters turned down a plan, advanced then by the Group for Switzerland Without an Army, to scrap the army altogether.
A total of 73 percent of the voters from 26 Swiss cantons rejected a referendum Sunday that pacifists and left-wing parties had put forward to do away with mandatory service in the army, the Swiss public broadcast network SRF reported.
The Swiss have long prided themselves on their army, which requires part-time service from each male citizen between the ages of 18 to 34.
The Swiss government had urged voters to retain the conscription service, counter to what most Western European nations have done since the cold war.
Even though Switzerland maintained armed neutrality during World War I and World War II, many Swiss believe their military — including mandatory service — is a strong deterrent that has kept the small nation out of Europe’s wars.

Australia begins mass data retention under new lawImage copyright ReutersLarge amounts of telecommunications metadata must now be kept for two years by Australian telecommunications companies, under a new law which came into effect on Tuesday.
The authorities also point out that some of this data was already being retained by telecommunications companies, albeit on an ad hoc basis.
The security of the servers used to hold the data has also been a question, with mass data breaches becoming increasingly common around the world.
It covers data on who called or texted whom and for how long, as well as location, volume of data exchanged, device information and email IP data.
Some online services are also unsure about whether the law covers them and precisely what data they need to keep, the body said.

The state-controlled Russian firm that makes the Buk missile earlier released its own report which contradicted the Dutch findings.
However, both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries have Buk missile systems in their arsenal.
But the Ukrainian and Western governments have long blamed pro-Russian separatists for the crash, claiming they used a Russian-supplied Buk missile.
But it also stated: "It cannot be ruled out that some occupants remained conscious for some time during the one to one-and-a-half minutes for which the crash lasted."

Man who concluded Tamir Rice shooting reasonable also involved in clearing officers in shooting of Denver teenThe officers and a witness said the driver of the car, later identified as Hernandez, sped toward one of the officers.
They expressed sadness but a lack of surprise that a prosecutor and a former FBI agent would issue reports that appear to favor the officers in the Tamir shooting.
Within the span of a minute, the officers approached the car from both sides and shouted for the teens to get out.
Officers Gabriel Jordan and Daniel Greene were investigating a report of a suspicious vehicle parked in an alley.
Much like Tamir's death, Hernandez's killing sparked protests and calls for the district attorney to charge the officers.

Teen’s discovery of skeleton-filled fuselage in jungle could be MH370The coastal wreckage in Tawi Tawi was under investigation by local authorities in Malaysia’s Sabah region Monday.
The pilot had his safety belt on and the communication gear attached to his head and ears,” Omar told local police, Free Malaysia Today reports.
The youth and pals found “many skeletons” in the fuselage, Omar said, some still wearing seatbelts, and more human bones nearby.
The claim comes five weeks after French experts confirmed a piece of wing that washed up on Reunion Island near Madagascar was indeed from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.
A teenager hunting for birds in the jungle of a Philippine island claims to have stumbled upon a fuselage “full of skeletons” and a Malaysian flag, and authorities believe it could be from missing Flight MH370.

Billy The Kid Photograph Could Be Worth $5mA coin dealer in California has authenticated a grainy photograph of legendary gunman Billy the Kid with members of his gang which could be worth up to $5m (£3.3m).
The only other known photograph of the Kid was a portrait taken in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in 1880.
It was taken a month after the end of the Lincoln County war and captures the outlaws relaxing after a wedding.
"We had to be certain that we could answer and verify where, when, how and why this photograph was taken.
Pic: Kagin'sDavid McCarthy, senior numismatist at the dealer, said: "When we first saw the photograph, we were understandably sceptical - an original Billy the Kid photo is the Holy Grail of Western Americana.

Cannabis legalisation worth millionsCivil servants were asked to consider the "potential fiscal impacts of introducing a regulated cannabis market in the UK".
'216 tonnes'The Treasury study was undertaken earlier this year at the behest of the Liberal Democrats when they were in coalition, but was not published.
Legalising cannabis could generate hundreds of millions of pounds a year in tax and cut costs for the police and prisons, a government study has found.
The Treasury report argues that sum is probably an over-estimate.
But it agrees that regulating cannabis would raise significant amounts in tax, as well as saving the state up to £200m in court and police costs a year.

Watchdog slams Qatar labour rights recordHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has criticised the government of Qatar for not following through with pledged labour reforms ahead of the 2022 Word Cup.
Improving labour standardsThe US-based watchdog has said employers should stop confiscating the passports of migrant workers, and cease requiring exit permits for those trying to leave the country.
At a press conference on Thursday in the Qatari capital, Doha, the international non-governmental organisation said migrant workers in the Gulf state work under a "19th century labour system".
"If they are not able to even adhere to the minimum basic workers’ rights ... you will see more and more countries who will stop or boycott [them]," said Marieke Koning of the International Trade Union Confederation.
HRW urged Qatar to set a timetable to abolish the sponsorship system - known as kafala in Arabic - which restricts the rights of workers to travel, change jobs and complain about employer abuse.

Seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have been notified that the department intends to fire them for belonging to a secret law enforcement clique that allegedly celebrated shootings and branded its members with matching tattoos, officials said.
The Sheriff's Department has a long history of secret cliques with members of the groups having reached high-ranking positions within the agency.
In 2011, the department fired about half a dozen deputies who were also said to have formed a clique.
He dismissed concerns about the group's tattoo, noting that deputies throughout the department get matching tattoos.

Gunfire erupted on a packed Bourbon Street Saturday night amid Mardi Gras festivities.
Two women and two men were shot in the 400 block of Bourbon Street around 9:30 p.m., said officer Frank Robertson III, a spokesman for the New Orleans Police Department.
A New Orleans man, who declined to give his name, said he and his friends heard about the shooting before they went to Bourbon Street, but decided to go ahead anyway.
"We had more girls than guys at that point, and we were trying to make sure everyone was OK."In spite of the shooting, crowds on Bourbon Street remained strong throughout Saturday night.

Nearly four years ago we set up a coffee morning at Eye Library after the librarian at the time came up with the idea, and since then about seven of us have been going there every Tuesday.
It is health and safety gone through the roof.

Part of parking deck collapses in Atlanta - US news - LifeThe search of the parking deck was delayed when engineers spotted signs of bolts popping on the other side of the deck, said J.P. Spillane, an Atlanta police official.
The parking deck was last inspected at the time it was built and cleared for occupancy in 2002, said Catherine Woodling, spokeswoman for Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin.
Part of a six-floor parking deck near downtown Atlanta collapsed Monday, crushing at least 35 cars, with fire officials saying it was miraculous there were no reports of injuries hours after the mass of concrete fell during a busy lunchtime.
"We want to be absolutely sure the building is safe and there is no secondary collapse," Cochran said.

With more plastic in homes, residential fires are now likely to use up all the oxygen in a room before they consume all flammable materials.
But they are actually waiting for an inrush of fresh air, which can come as firefighters cut through roofs and break windows.
For instance, it has long been considered a cardinal sin for firefighters to spray water on a room full of smoke with no flames.
In one set of controlled burns, the Fire Department will study the efficacy of its standard approach to fighting basement fires — entering the house and descending the stairs to the basement.

http://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/prisoners-brazil-reduce-their-sentences-producing-electricity.html
Prisoners in Brazil Can Reduce Their Sentences by Producing ElectricityBut now, thanks to an innovative new initiative underway at a correctional facility in Brazil, prisoners are being given the chance to slash their sentences while bringing a bit of light into the world, literally -- by producing the electricity used to power street lamps.
For every 16 hours spent pedaling to charge a battery connected to the bike, prisoners of good standing will shave a day off their sentences.
Using the bikes isn't mandatory, but when their benefits are as win-win, there's no reason it needs to be.
Given the success of the program so far, the prison plans to add even more power-generating bikes which will go even further to reduce sentences, waistlines, electricity bills, and carbon emissions -- all while making the world a brighter place, in more ways than one.
The energy will then be used to power streetlights in the city that might otherwise be dark, making the community a safer place at night for everyone.

U.S. officials launched the attack without telling Pakistan for fear of tipping off the Al Qaeda leader.
U.S. and Pakistani officials said the CIA is still flying armed Predator and Reaper drones over Pakistan, and will kill an Al Qaeda leader if the aircraft find one.
The number of drone strikes in Pakistan has increased dramatically during the Obama administration.
In an effort to mend badly frayed relations with Pakistan, the CIA has suspended drone missile strikes on gatherings of low-ranking militants believed to be involved in cross-border attacks on U.S. troops or facilities in Afghanistan, current and former U.S. officials say.

Rush to Buy New Air Jordan Sneakers Leads to ArrestsWhen retailers around the country put the new retro Nike Air Jordan basketball shoe on sale Friday, they were hoping for a modest last-minute boost two days before Christmas.
“Clearly that wasn’t enough to control the crowds,” Mr. Murphy said.
The city of 19,000 had only nine other officers available, Mr. Murphy said.
It wasn’t just any sneaker they were after, but the Air Jordan 11 Retro Concord, a version of the shoe Michael Jordan first wore in 1995 and was promptly fined by the National Basketball Association for failing to conform to the league’s dress-code rules.
Oh, the joys of holiday shopping: the eve of Christmas Eve, Air Jordans and the sting of pepper spray in the eye.

CIA report: No issue with spy agency's partnership with N.Y. policeThe spy agency said the news report "mischaracterized the nature and scope" of the CIA's support for New York police.
The Associated Press reported that the NYPD Intelligence Division dispatched CIA-trained undercover officers into minority neighborhoods to gather intelligence on daily life in mosques, cafes, bars and bookstores.
"The IG also found no evidence that any part of the agency's support to the NYPD constituted 'domestic spying.'"
The alleged program "is a waste of precious resources, and it raises serious constitutional concerns," said Udi Ofer of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
But New York-area Muslims and civil liberties advocates have called for investigations and hearings after the AP report was published in August.

SEC requiring coal firms to report safety problemsThree investigations of Upper Big Branch, however, have since concluded the company regularly put production and profits before the health and welfare of its workers.
Still, in the year before the blast, MSHA issued more violation orders at Upper Big Branch than at any other U.S. mine.
The settlement wiped out 370 safety violations related to the worst U.S. mine disaster in four decades.
Between Jan. 1, 2009, and the day of the blast, MSHA cited Upper Big Branch for 645 violations and imposed penalties of more than $1.2 million.
They require companies to report within four days any “significant and substantial” violations, citations, flagrant violations and imminent-danger orders issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Washington spends £200m creating intelligence hub in BritainLike Menwith Hill, it is likely to be co-staffed with representatives of British intelligence, including GCHQ.
Labour MP Tom Watson, a former defence minister, said: "The new spend of $317m on facilities at RAF Croughton is a shocking revelation.
Details of the RAF Croughton project obtained by this newspaper show that the upgrade will involve the "consolidation" of six existing US intelligence groups, currently based at RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire, into a single facility at RAF Croughton.
Washington is to spend almost £200m to turn one of its British military bases – already implicated in mass surveillance and drone strikes – into one of its largest intelligence hubs outside the mainland United States.
A USAF briefing document makes it clear that the facility at RAF Croughton will be at the front line of intelligence activities and will include personnel from unnamed British agencies.

Fossilised bones of a dinosaur believed to be the largest creature ever to walk the Earth have been unearthed in Argentina, palaeontologists say.
There have been many previous contenders for the title "world's biggest dinosaur".
"Moreover, several different methods exist for calculating dinosaur weight (some based on overall volume, some on various limb bone measurements) and these don't always agree with each other, with large measures of uncertainty.

Myanmar democracy icon challenges powerful army to amend constitution this yearMyanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is challenging the powerful army to help amend the constitution that is barring her from running for president in next year's general elections.
Myanmar started moving from a half century of dictatorship to democracy three years ago, but the army still lurks heavily in the shadows.
The 2008 constitution drawn by the former military rulers gives the army 25 percent of all parliamentary seats, allows it to appoint three cabinet ministers and have veto power in changing the constitution.
The Nobel laureate says that the army is duty-bound to safeguard the country and should not be involved in running the administration.
Her comments during a rally in the second largest city of Mandalay on Sunday drew loud cheers.

The research could take three to five years and, if successful, could help banana farmers stay afloat, Hu said.
The banana bunchy top virus, which jumps from plant to plant with the help of aphids, was first found on Oahu in the 1989 and arrived in Kailua-Kona in the following decade.
Lynn Richardson said every week he finds infected banana plants on his 6-acre farm in Kurtistown.
He recently applied for a permit to import 300 transgenic banana plants from Kenya to determine their resistance levels, and hopes to begin greenhouse trials shortly.

The separate survey of households that is used to measure the jobless rate showed even brisker hiring in February.
Fed Chairman Bernanke last week described the labor market as "far from normal" and said continued improvement would require stronger demand for U.S. goods and services.

Roy Greenslade: US military condemned for not freeing Iraqi journalistThere is mounting anger at the US military's refusal to free a Reuters photojournalist - despite a release order by an Iraqi court.
The U.S. has said in the past that it has the right to keep holding security detainees even if an Iraqi court orders them freed.
"The American military officials in Iraq should stop interfering with the Iraqi justice and free Ibrahim."

But reducing shock tactics in advertising could reduce those figures further, Mr Erceg-Hurn said.
"They look at those ads and they don't see themselves or their friends because the first few times they use ice they simply feel euphoria," the lead researcher, David Erceg-Hurn, said yesterday.
These ads could be backfiring, and it's time we looked at a new approach."
"There are cases where you can get too graphic and distance people from the message you are trying to deliver, but shock tactics do have their place and we have seen that most effectively in our anti-tobacco ads," he said.

Southwest inspecting 79 planes after hole prompts emergency landingSouthwest Flight 812, which had a five-member crew, then made an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 5:07 p.m. (7:07 p.m.
There authorities "discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft," the company said earlier.
National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said a preliminary investigation showed the aircraft suffered a "structural failure" and "depressurization" that prompted the emergency landing.
(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines announced Saturday that it is grounding 79 planes for inspection after a 3- to 4-foot hole tore open in the fuselage of one of its planes, bringing a view of the blue sky and a white-knuckled emergency descent.
The plane -- which had been traveling from Phoenix to Sacramento, California -- managed to make an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, on Friday.

Clarence Thomas writes one of the cruelest Supreme Court decisions ever.Both Thomas and Scalia have produced what can only be described as a master class in human apathy.
But this case is of a piece with prior decisions in which Thomas and Scalia have staked out positions that revel in the hyper-technical and deliberately callous.
In 1963, in Brady v. Maryland, the Supreme Court held that prosecutors must turn over to the defense any evidence that would tend to prove a defendant's innocence.
I don't ask that Thomas or Scalia shed a tear for an innocent man who almost went to his death because of deceptive prosecutors.
Yet the four prosecutors in Thompson's case managed to keep secret the fact that they had hidden exculpatory evidence for 20 years.

Murder in Afghanistan: SPIEGEL TV's 'Kill Team' DocumentarySPIEGEL TV's Karin Assmann spent weeks alongside her colleagues from SPIEGEL magazine researching the story behind the men of the 5th Stryker Brigade, exploring why they had gone so horribly off course.
You can now view Assmann's documentary, in its entirety, on SPIEGEL ONLINE International.
Time and time again, he had asked his roommate in this remote outpost in Afghanistan not to do drugs, at least not in their room.
Most troubling was the fact that they had posed with the dead, smiling and holding up their heads like hunters proud of their "kill."
Assmann reconstructs two of the three alleged murders using the very photos that the US Army has tried to suppress.

There were 37 priests, according to a scathing report by the grand jury, which was released last month.
It gave the priests' files to law enforcement, and a grand jury began to investigate.
In fact, the grand jury report excoriated the Philadelphia review board because it rejected every allegation it did hear as "unsubstantiated."
In Cleveland, for example, the diocese said that 28 priests had been accused of abuse, but when a prosecutor looked at the files, the estimate went to 145.

Pope Francis denounces ‘trickle-down’ economic theories in sharp criticism of inequalityRead the document Pope Francis denounces inequality In a paper outlining a philosophy that he says will guide his papacy, Pope Francis decries an "idolatry of money" and warns it would lead to "a new tyranny."
On some issues — such as income inequality and poverty — he is echoing concerns long pursued by his predecessors.
Pope Francis on Tuesday sharply criticized growing economic inequality and unfettered markets in a wide-ranging and decidedly populist teaching that revealed how he plans to reshape the Catholic Church.
Many of the world’s richest countries are experiencing historic levels of income inequality.
And Pope John Paul II’s warnings on economic inequality were swallowed at times by his war on Communism, a far more dangerous problem in the church’s eyes because of its anti-religious bent.

CIA turned some Guantanamo Bay prisoners into double agents against al-QaedaIn the early years after Sept. 11, 2001, the CIA turned some Guantanamo Bay prisoners into double agents, sending them home to help the United States kill terrorists, current and former U.S. officials said.
The U.S. government says it has confirmed that about 16 percent of former Guantanamo Bay detainees rejoined the fight against the United States.
Officials said the program ended in 2006 as the flow of detainees to Guantanamo Bay slowed to a trickle.
But those who were aware of the cluster of cottages knew it best by its sobriquet: Penny Lane.
Al-Qaeda suspected that the CIA would attempt a program like this, and its operatives have been very suspicious of former Guantanamo Bay detainees, intelligence officials and experts said.

In a far-reaching interview with Israeli investigative programme Uvda, Mr Milchan detailed a series of clandestine affairs worthy of any of his blockbuster films, including how he helped purchase technologies Israel allegedly needed to operate nuclear bombs.

Men used to have their first heterosexual experience at a younger age but now it is the same for women.
For men the equivalent figure was 1.4%, according to the research, which is published in the Lancet today.
One in 10 women in Britain say they have been forced into having sex against their will, the most comprehensive survey of Britons' sexual behaviour for decade reveals today, prompting a warning from researchers that sexual coercion may have become "normalised".

SEATTLE – A campaign to set a $15 minimum wage in the city of SeaTac is poised for victory.
Heather Weiner, a spokeswoman for the campaign supporting the initiative, said voters can be difficult to reach because some work multiple jobs.
The campaign for the SeaTac measure drew some $1.8 million in spending in the small city, with national labor groups supporting the effort and national business groups opposing it.
Gary Smith, a spokesman for opposition group Common Sense SeaTac, said the campaign hasn’t made a final decision about whether to seek a recount.

The ban on smoking in parks is the latest proposal from Mayor Bloomberg to curtail New Yorkers' bad habits.
In September, he formally called for the ban, which requires City Council approval.
"Parks and beaches are places where people sit and talk and they deserve to be smoke-free," said bill sponsor Gale Brewer (D-Manhattan).
Opponents crowed about civil liberties, but came up short in rallying enough votes to strike down the ban.

Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square, where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis.
Mubarak's opponents had stood shoulder to shoulder in Tahrir Square to call for his immediate resignation in a massive rally on Tuesday.

Made in Africa: Bamboo bikes put Zambian business on right trackEye-catching, super light and extremely durable, bamboo bicycles have gained traction in recent years, becoming a popular alternative to traditional steel or aluminium bikes.
With a price tag of around $900, the company's bamboo bikes are primarily aimed at the international market, with countries such as Japan, Singapore, Germany, Brazil, Finland and the United States driving demand.
As well as their bamboo bikes, Zambikes is also making steel bicycles to cater to the local market's needs for cheap transport, having so far produced about 10,000 of them.
"It's a plus to have a product that is grown in Africa, made in Africa and exported to everywhere else in the world," says Zambikes co-founder Mwewa Chikamba.
Dubbed Zambikes , the company is putting its custom-built Zambian bikes on roads around the world, offering pedal enthusiasts a unique ride while helping to empower local communities back home.

George Zimmerman’s bond revoked, must surrenderDuring Zimmerman's bail hearing in April, his family testified they had limited funds, prosecutors said on Friday during court proceedings broadcast live.
A Florida judge has revoked the bond of George Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watchman accused of killing teen Trayvon Martin, on the grounds that Zimmerman misled the court about his finances.
In revoking the bond, Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. said Zimmerman "can't sit back and obtain the benefits of a lower bond or circumstances based upon ... material falsehoods."
"We fully expect that the special prosecutor will make George Zimmerman's credibility be front and center in this entire case," he told reporters.
He pointed to $135,000 in funds the couple had raised from the public that was not disclosed during the hearing.

"If this [the money] wasn't relevant to bond then why did they lie about it?
But later that month, Mark O'Mara, an attorney for Zimmerman, told the court at a bond hearing, "As far as his financial abilities, unfortunately, this is a family of very short means."
West resigned from his post at the federal public defender's office in Orlando specifically to join O'Mara and defend Zimmerman.

Confirmed: US and Israel created Stuxnet, lost control of it“They went too far.”Once released more widely, the Stuxnet code was found and then disassembled by security researchers.
When Barack Obama came to office, he continued the program—called "Olympic Games"—which unpredictably disabled bits of the Natanz plant even as it told controllers that everything was normal.
When the coders found the right sets of commands to literally shake the centrifuges apart, they knew that Stuxnet could work.
That program, first authorized by George W. Bush, worked well enough to provide a digital map of Natanz and its industrial control hardware.
By doing so, both governments hoped to set back the Iranian research program—and the US hoped to keep Israel from launching a pre-emptive military attack.

Zhang Ziyi investigated in Chinese sex scandal“The accusations made against award-winning actress Zhang Ziyi are completely false and defamatory,” Zhang’s rep told E!
Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress best known for her intense, knife-wielding role in “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” has become the latest name associated with the growing shroud of scandal surrounding Chinese politician Bo Xilai.
Reports accuse the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi of sleeping with the scandal-ridden politician Bo Xilai multiple times.
“We will seek justice for Zhang Ziyi by taking legal action against Apple Daily and against any other media publishing these false reports.”jchen@nydailynews.com
A claim appearing on Chinese social media site Sina Weibo initially said Zhang is currently being detained in China, but the Hong Kong University-based Chinese Media Project reports that the posts have since been removed.

In U.S., 46% Hold Creationist View of Human OriginsThe prevalence of this creationist view of the origin of humans is essentially unchanged from 30 years ago, when Gallup first asked the question.
About a third of Americans believe that humans evolved, but with God's guidance; 15% say humans evolved, but that God had no part in the process.
The 32% who choose the "theistic evolution" view that humans evolved under God's guidance is slightly below the 30-year average of 37%, while the 15% choosing the secular evolution view is slightly higher (12%).
Highly religious Americans most likely to believe in creationismPRINCETON, NJ -- Forty-six percent of Americans believe in the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years.
Majority of Republicans Are CreationistsHighly religious Americans are more likely to be Republican than those who are less religious, which helps explain the relationship between partisanship and beliefs about human origins.

Bret Michaels Hospitalized with 'Warning Stroke'RELATED: Spoiler Alert: Did Bret Michaels Win Celebrity Apprentice?
Bret Michaels suffered a serious setback in his recovery from a brain hemorrhage, experiencing a small “warning stroke” that sent him to the hospital, where tests then revealed he also has a hole in his heart.
But his doctor questioned whether Michaels can return as hoped to the May 23 finale of Celebrity Apprentice or to a concert on May 28.
MRI and CT scans then discovered that Michaels had a hole in his heart.
“There is no doubt that [this] is devastating news to Bret and his family,” says Zabramski.

9/11 Truth Movement Perspective - PTB have their hands fullThe 911 Truth Movement is gaining momentum and may already be too large for the PTB to effectively contain.
Like many others, I believe that the worlds' enlightenment by the 9/11 Truth Movement is of great concern to the planners for the "Powers That Be" (PTB).
Why did the government employees writing the MIAC Strategic Report not list members of the 9/11 Truth Movement as possible extremists or militia members?
I have no doubt that within multiple government agencies, their agents are told that various 9/11 Truth Movement organizations and their members are to be considered dangerous or extremists.
However do you remember the buzzing from within the Patriot and 9/11 Truth movements in regards to the MIAC Strategic Report in early 2009?

Businessweek reports on a study of the health consequences of WTC dust for Ground Zero workers...
Such workers were rendered almost totally unable to detect irritants, the researchers found.
In terms of irritant detection, such long-term smelling impairment was harshest among those who were on the World Trade Center site immediately following the buildings' collapse.

BP: Oil leak could be stopped by next weekBP America Chairman Lamar McKay said Wednesday that the figure used by the oil spill response team had a degree of "uncertainty" built into it.
Earlier in the day, BP acknowledged that the underwater gusher is bigger than estimated to date, as new video showed a cloud of crude billowing around its undersea siphon.
Meanwhile, the Coast Guard announced the creation of a federal Flow Rate Technical Group to assess the actual flow rate from the well.
Washington (CNN) -- A BP official says a gusher of oil pouring from its damaged Gulf of Mexico well could be shut off as early as next week.

House votes to expand national DNA arrest databaseCCTV will be properly regulated, as will the DNA database, with restrictions on the storage of innocent people's DNA.
In a surprise move, as the U.S. Congress was expanding the FBI's DNA database, the U.K.'s new coalition government was pledging sharp curbs on its own databases.
The attorney general would be required to report to Congress which states have and have not signed up for the DNA database.
If states do follow suit, it's difficult to overstate how many more DNA samples would flood into the FBI's Convicted Offender DNA Index System (CODIS) database.
A 2000 federal law called the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act required that DNA samples be taken from anyone convicted of or on probation for certain serious crimes.

The suspect is seen tying his shoes, putting on his light jacket and then appears to notice the watch.
Authorities are unsure which flight the suspect boarded, but he may have been on a flight to Charlotte, the paper reported.
On Jan. 18, Gloria de Regalado, 43, was passing through Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, heading back to her home in Lexington, Ky, The Sun Sentinel reported.
Once on the concourse, de Regalado said she made eye contact with the suspect, and realized her items were left behind, the report said.

Married couples who play together stay together(In couples married 11 to 19 years, women said 17.8 weeks, and men said nine.)
Pennsylvania State University sociologist Paul Amato and colleagues analyzed national surveys of 2,034 married couples in 1980 and a similar sample of 2,100 in 2000.
Markman, a baseball fan, doesn't claim that watching baseball is responsible for saving marriages, but he does say it offers couples some fun.
Markman and co-director Scott Stanley in 1996 began a long-term study of 306 Denver-area couples.
One of the reasons couples have trouble is that they have different takes on fun and bonding, Parrott says.

Row upon row of couples, dressed in white dresses and tuxedos, met at the Cheongshim Peace World Centre in Gapyeong, about 37 miles northeast of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, for their big day.
He presided over mass weddings from the early 1960s and in 1997, 30,000 couples were married in Washington.
Moon founded the church, officially called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, in 1954 and it is considered one of the world's most controversial religious organisations.

It's not the first time political rivals and ideological foes have joined forces in Israel's coalition government system.
Nearly a month after the election, Netanyahu has yet to announce a single partner, with a mid-March deadline looming.
Lapid puts a two-state solution near the top of his agenda, while Bennett bitterly opposes Palestinian statehood.
Netanyahu is now exploring whether he can reach a Knesset majority without either Yesh Atid or Jewish Home.

Brown releases proposed rules for frackingSACRAMENTO — The Brown administration has released much-anticipated proposed rules for fracking, a controversial technique for drilling for oil and natural gas reviled by environmentalists.
The regulations cover fracking and related techniques, and they provide substantial new public information about where and how fracking is taking place.
Nevertheless, even some opponents conceded that the proposed regulations were better than nothing.
Environmentalists contend that fracking could pollute drinking water wells, endanger public health and release greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
Friday's proposed regulations were in response to a state law approved by the Legislature this year.

"We are people who want to drastically change the political system in Russia and put an end to the Putin regime in this country," Verzilov told Al Jazeera earlier this month.

A remote-controlled aerial target drone malfunctioned and struck the ship off the coast of Southern California shortly before 1:30 p.m., Navy Lt. Lenaya Rotklein said.
Two sailors aboard the guided missile cruiser Chancellorsville were injured and the ship was damaged when it was hit by a drone Saturday, a Navy official said.
According to manufacturer Northrop Grumman, the MQM/BQM-74 series of aerial targets has been the workhorse of the Navy's subsonic aerial target inventory since 1968.
The BQM-74E has provided over 80 percent of all U.S. Navy target presentations, the company says.

3 Are Dead in Colorado Springs Shootout at Planned Parenthood CenterOfficials from both law enforcement and Planned Parenthood said they did not know whether the group’s Colorado Springs center had been specifically targeted.
Planned Parenthood’s Colorado Springs center was one of many locations around the country that became the site of large anti-abortion protests over the summer after abortion opponents released surreptitious videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing using fetal organs for research.
At Fusion Nails, in the shopping complex south of the Planned Parenthood center, Quan Hoang said he was working when he saw police cars swarming in the parking lot near a bank down the street.
In a statement, Vicki Cowart, president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said the group had strong safety measures and worked closely with local law enforcement.
Earlier Friday morning, Mr. Lambert said, some of his employees heard gunshots but did not know where they were coming from.

Paris climate activists put under house arrest using emergency lawsAt least 24 climate activists have been put under house arrest by French police, accused of flouting a ban on organising protests during next week’s Paris climate summit, the Guardian has learned.
French authorities did not respond to requests for comment but lawyers said that the warrants were issued under state of emergency laws, imposed after the terror attacks that killed 130 people earlier this month.
The author and climate change campaigner, Naomi Klein, accused French authorities of “a gross abuse of power that risks turning the summit into a farce”.
One legal adviser to the activists said many officers raided his Paris apartment and occupied three floors and a staircase in his block.
Thousands of climate campaigners, including high-profile Indian activist Vandana Shiva, have vowed to defy the blanket ban on demonstrations.

Russia to halt visa-free status for visiting TurksMoscow's statement comes amid reports that Russia has already started creating obstacles for Turks trying to go there.
Moscow is to suspend its visa-free agreement with Turkey at the beginning of next year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.
As of November 26, there were more than 9,900 Russian tourists in Turkey.
"A decision has been made to halt the visa-free regime with Turkey," Lavrov told reporters after talks with his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Muallem in Moscow.
Dozens of Turkish protesters shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest against Russia after Friday prayers in Istanbul.

China navy holds first joint anti-piracy drill with NATOThe exercise will help improve communications between ships on anti-piracy duties so that China and NATO can together maintain maritime security and stability in the Gulf of Aden, the ministry added.
BEIJING Nov 27 Chinese naval forces involved in anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden have held their first joint drill with NATO ships carrying out the same mission, China's Defence Ministry said on Friday, as China seeks a greater global security role.
However experts have said China is likely one day to have to overcome its discomfort about overseas military bases, as its forces are drawn into protecting its growing overseas interests.
China, whose merchant ships and oil tankers are heavy users of the waters off Yemen and Somalia, has been an enthusiastic participant in the anti-piracy patrols.
This week, China said it was in talks with the Horn of Africa country Djibouti to build logistics "facilities" to support Chinese peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions.

Employees pay 130% more for health care than a decade agoIn 2015, the average health-care rate increase for employees was 3.2%, the lowest increase since Aon started tracking this data in 1996.
Plus, 43% of companies are considering using unitized pricing, in which employees pay per person instead of individual versus family.
Employees of midsize and large companies in 2015 paid an average of $4,700 for their health insurance, up from $2,001 in 2005, according to recent analysis from Aon Hewitt.
Some 18% of companies are reducing subsidies for covered dependents, and 17% are adding a surcharge for adult dependents who have access to other health coverage.
Still, health-care rate increases are showing some signs of slowing down.

Wall Street's 2013 Bonuses Were More Than All Workers Earned Making the Federal MinimumThat’s because low-wage workers tend to spend nearly every dollar they make to meet their basic needs.
If the $26.7 billion Wall Streeters pulled in on their bonuses last year had instead gone to minimum wage workers, our economy would be expected to grow by about $32.3 billion — more than triple the $10.4 billion boost expected from the Wall Street bonuses.
When low-wage workers spend their money at the grocery store or on utility bills, this cash ripples through the economy.
According to my new report, every extra dollar going into the pockets of low-wage workers adds about $1.21 to the national economy.
According to the New York State Comptroller’s office, Wall Street firms handed out $26.7 billion in bonuses to their 165,200 employees last year, up 15 percent over the previous year.

One of the children shot dead in Friday's school shooting massacre was British, it has been reported.
His older brother Jake was also at Sandy Hook school but was not among those killed.
Six-year-old Dylan Hockley, whose family moved from Eastleigh in Hampshire to Newtown, Connecticut, nearly two years ago, was among 20 children and six adults killed by Adam Lanza.
His parents had chosen to live there because it was so safe, Dylan's mother Nicole had told the Newton Bee local newspaper before the shootings.

Stabbed south London teenager 'savaged by dogs'Oluwaseyi Ogunyemi, known as Seyi, died in Larkhall Park, south London, where he was stabbed six times following the dog attack last April, the court heard.
Chrisdian Johnson, 22, Shane Johnson, 20, both of South Lambeth, London, and Darcy Menezes, 18, of Clapham, London, deny murder and attempted murder.
'Not alone' Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, told the court two dogs had been used in the attack.
All three defendants were "both present and participating in the general attack albeit in different ways," Mr Altman told the jury.
The two gangs had been "patrolling" the estate before merging to form the "attacking group" at the entrance to the park, the court heard.

Google to enlist NSA to help it ward off cyberattacksAny agreement would mark the first time that Google has entered a formal information-sharing relationship with the NSA, sources said.
The pact would be aimed at allowing the NSA help Google understand whether it is putting in place the right defenses by evaluating vulnerabilities in hardware and software and to calibrate how sophisticated the adversary is.
"The critical question is: At what level will the American public be comfortable with Google sharing information with NSA?"
On Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair called the Google attacks, which the company acknowledged in January, a "wake-up call."
Google approached the NSA shortly after the attacks, sources said, but the deal is taking weeks to hammer out, reflecting the sensitivity of the partnership.

State Farm cancels thousands of Fla. policies - Business - Personal financeJim Thompson, president of State Farm Florida, called the arrangement “an important step,” saying it would help “stem State Farm Florida’s deteriorating financial condition.”Policyholders have six monthsThe first of the cancellations will take effect at the beginning of August because state law requires six months’ notice, State Farm said.
A spokesman for State Farm said the decision was the direct result of its failure to win a 47.1 percent rate increase from state regulators.
The losses for State Farm are especially large because it is the largest insurer in the state.
To mitigate the impact, State Farm agreed to allow its agents to place canceled policyholders with other companies.
It said those agents could continue to service the policies even though they were no longer with State Farm.

Critics say the campaign’s lack of a philosophical focal point doesn’t represent creative swing state politics, but greed.
With passage, Ohio would become the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana after Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska.
A ballot proposal before Ohio voters next month would be the first in the nation to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana in a single vote.
We shake it up in a big, big way,” said Ian James, director of ResponsibleOhio, the legalization campaign.

Brelyn's husband was reportedly a virgin on their wedding day as well, though he does not seem to have provided a similar certificate.
Brelyn's mother posted a photo of her daughter's "certificate of purity" to her Facebook page.
At the ball, which started in 1998 and now takes place across the nation, fathers recite a covenant committing themselves to the protection of their daughter's purity.

Jacobson told the Denver Post that inmate, 27-year-old Mark Daniels, will be charged with assault on Holmes and assault on a correctional officer.
While the 27-year-old Holmes wasn't injured, the incident was serious enough to warrant charges against the other inmate.
"It was not an attack, it was a very minor incident in passing in a hallway," Adrienne Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections, told CNN.

Renewable power trumps fossil fuels for first timeRenewable power trumps fossil fuels for first timeThe findings indicate the world is shifting toward consuming more renewable energy even without a global agreement on limiting greenhouse gases.
Renewable energy is surpassing fossil fuels for the first time in new power-plant investments, shaking off setbacks from the financial crisis and an impasse at the United Nations global warming talks.
The 95-member WilderHill New Energy Index of renewable- energy stocks has tumbled 40 percent this year, steeper than the 14 percent drop in the MSCI World Index.
"The progress of renewables has been nothing short of remarkable," United Nations Environment Program Executive Secretary Achim Steiner said in an interview.
Accelerating installations of solar- and wind-power plants led to lower equipment prices, making clean energy more competitive with coal.

NEW YORK (AP) -- After nearly two years of bickering, NBA players and owners are back on the same side.
President Barack Obama gave a thumbs-up when told about the tentative settlement after he finished playing basketball at Fort McNair in Washington on Saturday morning.
But getting what the owners wanted took a toll.
Most of a season that seemed in jeopardy of being lost entirely will be salvaged if both sides approve the handshake deal.

Dunn, during his testimony, said he thought the music was “ridiculously loud” but denied calling it thug music.
A jury has declared that it could not reach a decision on whether a Florida man, who shot dead a teenager in a dispute over loud music, was guilty of murder or had acted in self defence.
The prosecution must decide whether to order a new trial on the first-degree murder charge.
He said he asked the boys “respectfully” to turn the music down, which he said they did at first.

Children Exposed to More Brain-Harming Chemicals Than Ever BeforeNow the same researchers have reviewed the literature and found six additional industrial chemicals that can hamper normal brain development.
“Our very great concern is that children worldwide are being exposed to unrecognized toxic chemicals that are silently eroding intelligence, disrupting behaviors, truncating future achievements and damaging societies, perhaps most seriously in developing countries,” they write.
The remaining chemicals, which are found in solvents and pesticides, have been linked to deficits in social development and increased aggressive behaviors.
But they say the growing body of research that is finding links between higher levels of these chemicals in expectant mothers’ blood and urine and brain disorders in their children should raise alarms about how damaging these chemicals can be.
The developing brain in particular, they say, is vulnerable to the effects of these chemicals, and in many cases, the changes they trigger are permanent.

Spartanburg County deputies said the couple were arguing at their Highway 357 home and at one point, Shannon Bridges hit her fiance in the head with a large Dale Jr. glass beer bottle.
Bridges told deputies the arrest was wrong because she had marks on her and she knew the law, according to the report.
When deputies asked Bridges what happened, she said her fiance attacked her and she hit him with the bottle in self-defense.
According to the report, Bridges began slapping herself and told her fiance she was going to call the police on him because she had marks on her.

The Model S continues to have the best safety track record of any vehicle in the world.
Also extremely important is the fact that there has never been a serious injury or death in a Model S as a result of a fire or any other cause.
Unlike the previous three fires, this one was actually triggered while the car was parked in a garage.

SECOND SNOW DAY FOR PHILADELPHIA SCHOOLSHeavy snow in and around New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, caused some schools to be closed for a second unplanned day on Friday.
The weather also slowed business for flower shops banking on a big day of deliveries on Friday for Valentine's Day.
Blue skies and temperatures in the 40s in the New York City area on Friday belied a previous night of unusual thunder snow and an electrical storm in New Jersey.

Grab Your 'Murse,' Pack a 'Mankini' And Don't Forget the 'Mewelry': Men's Fashion, Lingo Take a Feminine TurnThe invention of new words to describe men's fashion is a symptom of the recent boom in the men's fashion industry.
It's part of a special lexicon that has emerged, over the past decade, as a sort of shorthand for men's fashion.
Macy's men's fashion director Durand Guion says pockets just don't suffice for carrying an iPod, iPad and cellphone.
To the consternation of the fashion industry, the new terms are redefining fashion faux pas.
Male celebrities and a few fashion industry insiders are sporting an odd look for summer: Velvet slippers.

Feds Visit Homes of Solyndra CEO, ExecsFederal agents have expanded their examination of the now-bankrupt California solar power company Solyndra, visiting the homes of the company's CEO and two of its executives, examining computer files and documents, iWatch News and ABC News have learned.
Private investors will not be made whole, however, and stand to lose almost a billion dollars.
Solyndra spokesman David Miller confirmed agents visited Harrison's home on the same day the FBI and Energy Department Inspector General seized boxes of records from the company's headquarters.
One of the lead private investors in Solyndra was an Oklahoma billionaire who served as an Obama "bundler," raising money during the 2008 presidential campaign.

Bush Credits ‘The Work That Was Done’ During ‘My Presidency’ For Osama Bin Laden’s DeathDuring the interview, Bush thought he’d take the opportunity to pat himself on the back for Osama bin Laden’s death:Bush said the events that led to the death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May began during his administration.
Bush Credits ‘The Work That Was Done’ During ‘My Presidency’ For Osama Bin Laden’s DeathBy Ben ArmbrusterPresident Bush sat down with USA Today to discuss the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and his role in shaping U.S. policy in their aftermath.
“It began the day after 9/11.”The reality, of course, is that Bush’s attempts to capture or kill bin Laden were huge failures.
“The work that was done by intelligence communities during my presidency was part of putting together the puzzle that enabled us to see the full picture of how bin Laden was communicating and eventually where he was hiding,” he said.
“Shortly after I got into office,” Obama said in an interview after bin Laden’s death, “I brought [then-CIA director] Leon Panetta privately into the Oval Office and I said to him, ‘We need to redouble our efforts in hunting bin Laden down.

F-16 pilot was ready to give her life on Sept. 11Maj. Penny flew an F-16 on Sept. 11, 2001, that was destined to intercept and possibly bring down Flight 93.
“I would essentially be a kamikaze pilot.”In this 2011 interview, Major Heather Penney talks about how she heard about the Sept. 11 attacks.
Penney was prepared to give her life on Sept. 11 when she was ordered to down the hijacked planes — even knowing that the pilot for one of them could have been her father.
Because the surprise attacks were unfolding, in that innocent age, faster than they could arm war planes, Penney and her commanding officer went up to fly their jets straight into a Boeing 757.
She had her hand on the throttle of an F-16 and she had her orders: Bring down United Airlines Flight 93.

New York and D.C. alert as US warns of 'credible' terrorist threatFormer Bush administration Homeland Security official Fran Townsend told CNN that the threat, while credible, is unverified.
The most recent warning Thursday indicates that Al Qaeda and its affiliates have also considered attacks with small arms, homemade explosives, and poisons.
US intelligence specialists have picked up “lots of chatter” on jihadist websites, “and we’re taking it all seriously,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Thursday.
The United States is facing a “specific, credible, but unconfirmed” threat of a potential Al Qaeda attack on US soil, likely designed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to US officials.
“We know it’s an iconic day to Al Qaeda in part because of what was found at the [bin Laden] compound, so we are preparing accordingly,” she said.

Court: ISP Not Responsible When Subscribers Infringe CopyrightsEMI argued that HanseNet was involved in infringing its copyrights by providing Internet access to subscribers using a file-sharing links site.
Music giant EMI wanted the ISP to block a certain file-sharing site but the court decided otherwise and dismissed the case.
In its recent ruling, the Cologne Regional Court decided that as an ISP HanseNet is not liable for the infringements of its customers.
In a case brought by EMI against one of Germany's largest Internet service providers, a court has ruled that the ISP cannot be held liable when its subscribers infringe copyright.
HanseNet argued that as a mere conduit of information as detailed under the E-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, it is not responsible for the actions of others using its services.

UC Berkeley explosion, power outage may be related to copper theft, officials say – East Bay TimesLast week, campus officials discovered that someone had used heavy equipment to pull the copper out of the ground.
“We’re concerned if we bring power up there might be another explosion,” Mogulof said.
The explosion occurred as crews attempted to turn the power back on, said campus spokesman Dan Mogulof.
The incident may have been caused by an attempted copper theft in underground facilities near the Lawrence Hall of Science in the hills area of the campus, officials said.
BERKELEY — Four people suffered minor burns and a mandatory evacuation was ordered on the UC Berkeley campus Monday after an explosion and a campuswide power outage that may be related to thieves who ripped valuable copper wire out of the university’s electrical system, officials said.

A ministry spokesman said he was carrying a South Korean passport that identified him as Nam Yong-Ho, 47.
Fatal shore: The Imjin River, where the South Korean national was shot by his own nation's troops.
Because the 1950-53 Korean War concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, North and South Korea technically remain at war.
Defections from South to North Korea are very rare, and there has been no incident in recent memory where South Korean troops have shot anyone attempting the crossing.

US government shutdown: House votes to delay Obamacare lawThe impact of any federal shutdown would depend upon how long it lasts.
Congresswoman Cathy McManus Rogers, chair of the House Republican conference, said Reid was acting irresponsibly by refusing to hold a session of the Senate.
He was criticised by leading Republicans for failing to invite the Senate to debate the House resolution, less than 36 hours from the budget deadline.
"But instead, Republicans decided they would rather make an ideological point by demanding the sabotage of the healthcare law."
It also strips the new healthcare law, which is due to come into force on Tuesday, of a key tax on medical devices.

Second quarter GDP growth was 2 percent, and economists are predicting a 2013 GDP rise of 1.5 percent, or a bit higher.
Second, a government shutdown might reshape the modern Republican Party.
Overall GDP growth for the year was about 3 percent, and unemployment fell to 5.4 percent.
In fact, 2013 might be the most consequential shutdown ever, surpassing the impact of the Bill Clinton/Newt Gingrich standoffs of 1995 and 1996.

I have always believed this is the right public option, rather than creating a brand new bureaucracy.
The Medicare reforms are robust, meaningful, and will make Medicare the most viable public option of all.
More significantly, Grayson's introduction of this bill right now invites Dennis Kucinich to stand down on his opposition to the Senate bill.
Those remodels are already in the Senate bill, in the form of innovation, streamlining, electronic health records and outcomes-based medicine.

Scientists to review climate bodyUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked the world's science academies to review work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Work will be co-ordinated by the Inter-Academy Council, which brings together bodies such as the UK's Royal Society.
The Inter-Academy Council will convene a panel of experts to conduct the review, and will be run independently of UN agencies.
Inside and out Robbert Dijkgraaf, the council's co-chair, said the review panel will be chosen so that it includes both inside knowledge of the IPCC and outside perspectives.
The IPCC has been under pressure over errors in its last major assessment of climate science in 2007.

Report: Fixing FBI’s Computer System Will Cost More, Take LongerIn a report released Wednesday, the Office of the Inspector General expressed " serious concerns " about the progress of the FBI's project to overhaul its archaic computer system.
The project is now projected to cost $451 million and take until 2011, according to the new report.
It reported that the project would take at least nine months longer--and cost at least $26 million more--than originally planned.
The FBI's computer system has long been considered out of date, and the effort to overhaul it has failed once before with a different contractor, wasting more than $100 million.
The FBI wants a new system to create a way to process, store and manage its investigative records, which are currently paper-based.

Beginning in the 2012 model year, automakers must improve fleet-wide fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 5 percent a year.
The Obama administration signed off on the nation's first rules on greenhouse gas emissions Thursday and set new fuel standards that will raise current standards by nearly 10 mpg by the 2016 model year.

Jaikumar Vijayan covers data security and privacy issues, financial services security and e-voting for Computerworld.
The NSA can similarly retain inadvertently collected data on U.S. residents if the data contain information relevant to cybersecurity or evidence of a threat of harm to persons or property.
Two lawsuits have already been filed against the administration, the Justice Department and the NSA over the data collection programs.
On Thursday, two lawmakers introduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives that would require the Department of Justice to declassify significant decisions made by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Public views on privacy, security put US in tight spotPublic views on privacy, security put US in tight spot Updated: 2013-06-21 11:36 By Joe Boris (China Daily)Alongside the many questions about self-outed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, Americans have revived a debate weighing their desire for privacy against their government's post-9/11 intelligence-gathering demands.
As in the US, attitudes about online privacy in China tend to vary by generation, Wang said.
Complicating, though not necessarily contradicting, the privacy picture is the frequency with which millions of Americans voluntarily share personal information online.
Data collection under the program, called Prism, is supposed to be limited to communications that originate outside the United States.
Other polls have shown younger Americans don't have the same conventional expectations of privacy as their elders.

Daily Mail to pay £125,000 libel damages over TV psychic 'scam' claimShe went on to front a number of shows, including Sky Living's documentary Psychic Sally Big Fat Operation and series Psychic Sally on the Road.
The Daily Mail has apologised and agreed to pay £125,000 in libel damages to a TV psychic it falsely accused of using a hidden earpiece to scam a theatre audience.
Following the claim, Morgan issued a statement debunking the claim as "nonsense" and the theatre separately denied there had been any scam.
The solicitor Brid Jordan appeared on behalf of the Daily Mail publisher, Associated Newspapers, and apologised unreservedly for the hidden earpiece claim "which it accepts is untrue".
Morgan, who claims on her website to "see and hear dead people", first appeared on TV with the ITV2 series Sally Morgan: Star Psychic in 2007.

Calgary under water as province braces for more floodingIn Calgary, the 17,000-seat Saddledome -- home to the NHL Calgary Flames -- was flooded, along with parts of Calgary Zoo and the Calgary Stampede grounds, where the famous annual Calgary Stampede rodeo is scheduled to take place in less than two weeks.
Residents in Calgary seemed alternately shocked by the flooding and willing to take it in stride.
Clean water continued to flow to homes, but the city asked residents to limit their use as much as possible.
High River is one of several communities where residents have been evacuated because of the flooding.
Officials said most of the city's many bridges were holding against the water, but at least one was under water and another had washed out.

No Email For NSW Education Department Staff Due to OutageThe NSW Department of Education and Communities is recovering from a major email outage that has affected about 135,000 staff since Monday, including school and TAFE teachers.
In October last year, the email account of the NSW director general of education was allegedly hacked and an email sent to all staff criticising cuts to education funding.
"There has been an issue with school staff access to some computer services, including email," the department told Delimiter on Thursday.
"This issue has been resolved and access to the affected department systems are being restored progressively," a spokesman for the department told Fairfax Media on Friday morning.
As well as affecting email, the outage also reportedly affected access to other IT systems, Delimiter reported.

Judge orders CHP to return 60 pounds of marijuanaThe California attorney general's guidelines regarding medical marijuana indicate that collectives are allowed to both grow and transport quantities of marijuana for its members.
But defense attorney Glen T. Jonas argued that his client was a member of a Venice-based medical marijuana collective and that he was authorized to transport the marijuana.
With the debate on medical marijuana still at a full boil in Los Angeles, a judge Friday ordered the return of 60 pounds of pot to a man after his attorneys successfully argued that a state law gave him the right to transport it.
Saguro Doven, 33, was initially charged with possession of marijuana for sale and transportation of the drug, a violation of the state's health and safety code.
The marijuana was bundled in individual bags that were tucked inside a larger duffel bag when Doven was pulled over on the 101 Freeway by a California Highway Patrol officer, according to court records.

Study: 'Fossil' Words Are Older Than We Thought : The Two-Way : NPRHowever, the study's authors, including biologist Mark Pagel, (see his TED Talk from 2011 here), believe some ultraconserved words have survived 150 centuries or more.
These "fossil" words imply there was a "proto-Eurasiatic" language that is the common ancestor of about 700 languages that exist today, according to the study.
As The Washington Post writes:"The traditional view is that words can't survive for more than 8,000 to 9,000 years.
Study: 'Fossil' Words Are Older Than We ThoughtThe origin of some of the words we use today goes back much further than scientists once thought, suggesting an Ice Age-era proto-language that spawned many of the world's contemporary linguistic groups, according to a new study by a group of U.K.-based scientists.
Evolution, linguistic 'weathering' and the adoption of replacements from other languages eventually drive ancient words to extinction, just like the dinosaurs of the Jurassic era."

The EF-5 tornado that ravaged Joplin, Mo., two years ago, had estimated wind speeds as high as 250 mph and killed 158 people.
Just two years after a ferocious series of tornado outbreaks killed hundreds of Americans, the USA so far this year is enjoying one of the calmest years on record for twisters.

Economic Crisis Forces Local Governments to Let Asphalt Roads Return to GravelA gravel road "is not a free road," says Purdue University's John Habermann, who organized a recent seminar about the resurgence of gravel roads titled "Back to the Stone Age."
Some experts caution that gravel roads can be costlier in the long run than consistently maintained asphalt because gravel needs to be graded and smoothed.
But instead of laying a blanket of steaming blacktop, the machine was grinding the asphalt road into bits.
"Our expenses outweigh the income," says Mr. Zimmerman, who has been with the county highway department for nearly 30 years.
Gravel becomes a cheaper option once an asphalt road has been neglected for so long that major rehabilitation is necessary.

Naomi Campbell and blood diamond: the whole pictureThirteen years after the dinner, Miss Campbell, 40, is now preparing to appear before a war-crimes tribunal to discuss the events of that evening.
Miss Campbell has consistently denied receiving diamonds from Taylor, despite Miss Farrow's insistence to the contrary.
Courtenay Griffiths QC, defending Mr Taylor, told The Sunday Telegraph: "There is no substance to it whatsoever.
Charles Taylor was there and Naomi was seated next to him."
Mr Taylor, in turn, was said to be smitten with the beautiful British model by his side.

Exploring the Crazy Conspiracy Theories Bubbling Up Around the BP DisasterExploring the Crazy Conspiracy Theories Bubbling Up Around the BP DisasterYou've heard the latest one, right?
While carefully dissecting the anatomy of over a dozen of the past century's most famous conspiracy theories, Aaronovitch also draws some thoughtful insights about the nature of conspiracy theories: how they start, who believes them, and what psychological purpose they serve.
Conspiracy theories are always a clear sign that people's faith government and private institutions has been repeatedly shattered, but never mended.
We're Never WrongSome conspiracy theories start when a group attempts to deflect humiliation after being proven categorically, undeniably, embarrassingly wrong.

No victims found under collapsed New Jersey parking garage(CNN) -- A "major tragedy was averted" Saturday as officials announced no one had died in a New Jersey parking garage collapse.
Engineers were assessing the structural integrity of the apartments attached to the parking structure.
Those living in the apartment building adjacent to the garage were not allowed to stay there Friday night, Lindner said.
Lindner said three stories of the underground parking structure "pancaked," one on top of the next.
He said at a morning news conference that "a major tragedy was averted by no one getting crushed under tons of concrete and debris."

In response, Weaver told the judge: 'This is the first chance I have been given and I have grasped it.'
Judge Martin Picton said Weaver had caused his victims 'a lot of harm' and his crimes deserved 'years' in prison.
He admitted: 'I am taking a big chance on you because these are serious offences which caused a lot of harm.

Italian woman stunned by exploding artichoke • The RegisterAn Italian woman was left shaken but otherwise unhurt by an exploding artichoke, La Repubblica reports.
The unnamed victim bought some fresh artichokes from her local supermarket in Olginate, some 40km northeast of Milan.
The supermarket pulled remaining stocks of the potentially volatile vegetable, while police probe a possible link to previous incidents.
La Repubblica notes that artichoke explosions occurred in 2003 and 2008 - the latter in the province of L'Aquila, which was at first though to be a "Unabomber-style attack".
However, it appears a chemical reaction provoked by fertilisers may be the explanation, rather than a chilling suicide-bombing Day of the Triffids scenario.

Close call as ice rained from sky at AnnadelSome astonished visitors to Annadel State Park say they're grateful they weren't hit and killed when two large chunks of ice fell from a cloudless sky.
Schuelke said the first object they found was "a large chunk of ice that had indented the ground and broken into smaller chunks."
Leaks in aircraft toilets can cause ice bombs, but those are tinted the deep blue of an aviation toilet's liquid disinfectant.
O'Harren said the objects slammed into the ground close enough to him, Schuelke and four women hikers at a nearby picnic table to count as scary.
Both O'Harren and Schuelke searched the Internet and found that the possibilities include naturally occurring atmospheric ice conglomerations called megacryometeors, and frozen wastewater that falls off jetliners.

Man facing charges for urinating on Art Modell's graveMaryland authorities said Tuesday they will charge a man with disorderly conduct in a cemetery for allegedly urinating on the grave of former Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell.
''Bringing charges against this individual should act as a deterrent to others and assure the rest of us that no matter who you are, indecencies will not be committed against your final resting place.''
David Modell, Art Modell's son, said the family is thankful for the efforts of Baltimore County police and the decision by the state's attorney to file charges.
Shellenberger said the man will not be identified until charges are filed and served.
Modell served as league president from 1967-69, helped finalize the first collective bargaining agreement with the players in 1968 and was the point man for the NFL's lucrative contracts with television networks.

Soldiers returning from war, for example, could be asked to turn in their firearms if they were at higher risk, Kaminsky said.
Researchers claim a simple blood test could indicate a person’s predisposition to suicide.
Suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for Americans, according to the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention.
The organization aims to reduce the national suicide rate by 20 percent within five years through research and identifying those at greatest risk.

Exclusive: Cuomo intervened in BNP deal to get $1 billion more for NY state fundState and federal authorities have in past cases involving sanctions violations shown they have some discretion in how to divide settlement money.
The state’s general fund was already set to receive $2.24 billion from a state regulator’s piece of the settlement, and the eleventh-hour deal pushed the state’s take up to $3.29 billion.
The fund Vance planned to use this time, controlled by the U.S. Department of Treasury, holds proceeds from asset forfeitures and is available to fund projects by law enforcement agencies around the country.
Vance then followed an existing revenue sharing agreement between New York City and New York State, and directed roughly half of his office's share into each general fund.
It is unclear why Vance favored channeling the BNP money to a federal fund given the restrictions on its use.

Late in 2003, executives from HCA’s headquarters in Nashville dispatched a group that oversees its hospitals’ cardiac care to investigate.
Some doctors accused in the reviews of performing unnecessary procedures are still practicing at HCA hospitals.
Questions about the necessity of medical procedures — especially in the realm of cardiology — are not uncommon.

"We may never see cloned horses in the Olympics," Cook said.
According to Graeme Cooke, veterinary director for the FEI, the most common use for cloned horses is to perpetuate genetic material.
In analyzing cloned horses, the federation determined that the clones were only 98 percent copies of the originals.

FDA warns Nestle, others for misleading food claimsThe FDA plans to issue draft guidelines for nutritional labeling and to work with the food industry on a new labeling system, she added.
In a letter to baby food maker Gerber, a unit of Nestle, the FDA cited issues with Gerber 2nd Foods Carrot and Graduates Fruit Puffs products.
A Nestle spokesman said the company was cooperating with the FDA but does not comment on pending regulatory inquiries.
The warnings come as the FDA is set to push for new package labeling to make it easier for people to understand the nutritional content of food.
The FDA wants the companies to immediately correct the products' labeling and respond to the agency within 15 days from the date of the letter.

Wireless Tasers extend the long arm of the lawThe Taser XREP is an electrically charged dart that can be fired from up to 20 metres away with a 12-gauge shotgun.
TASER stun guns are going wireless, doubling their range.
While the XREP delivers a lower voltage for a longer time, a spokeswoman for Taser says its effect is similar to existing versions.
But grabbing the dart routes the shock through the hand, making it difficult to let go and spreading the pain further.
Commercial production of the XREP is due to start later this month, with US police departments and the US military expected to be using the weapons by the end of 2009.

New York Seas to Rise Twice as Much as Rest of U.S.(Related: "Small Melting Glaciers Will Speed Sea Level Rise, Study Says.")
Driven by changes in ocean circulation, the rapid sea level rise will bring increased risk of damage from hurricanes and winter storm surges, researchers say.
Sea levels around New York City and much of the U.S. Northeast will rise twice as much as in other parts of the United States this century, according to new climate models (U.S. Northeast map).
New climate models predict that global warming will reduce the sinking of the cold water that drives the Gulf Stream.
As water around the current warms, it will expand, adding to the sea level rise caused by global factors such as melting ice caps and icebergs, the study says.

Psychiatric Drug Use of German Shooter Confirmed: Kretschmer Withdrawing from Depression TreatmentFrom the facts that were known yesterday, it was already apparent that the shooter, Tim Kretschmer, was either on psychiatric medications or withdrawing from them.
School shootings are, without question, a direct effect of drugging teens with psychiatric medications.
Kretschmer is a victim of chemical child abuseIt is almost certainly not mere coincidence that this German shooter specifically targeted and killed a psychiatric worker.
Mike AdamsNatural NewsFriday, March 13, 2009(NaturalNews) Yesterday we reported on the recent school shooting in Germany, emphasizing the link between psychiatric medications and acts of extreme violence (http://www.naturalnews.com/025826.html).
Behind the scenes, I already knew from an industry source that Kretschmer had undergone psychiatric “treatment,” but I could not name that source and thus chose not to publish that fact until it could be further corroborated.

John McCain breaks ranks with GOP over CIA torture“The most important lead we got in the search for bin Laden came from using conventional interrogation methods.
I know in war good people can feel obliged for good reasons to do things they would normally object to and recoil from.
So what he has to say about the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) on CIA interrogation methods should be heeded.

Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on the organization’s website that the Senate report “should forever put to rest C.I.A.
“They deal with it as a fact.”“What makes a difference is what happens here, not some report published over there,” Mr. Alemad said.

Mars may have once had a massive lake, according to recent data revealed by the Curiosity Mars rover.
That crater, filled with water, was likely formed due to the build-up of sediment over an incredibly long period of time.
Gale Crater is the location at which scientists believe a 96-mile-wide crater existed.
The deposits are the first solid sign that scientists have had in some time that Mars very likely could have had a large body of water.

From the outset, the Minerva programme was slated to provide over $75 million over five years for social and behavioural science research.
A US Department of Defense (DoD) research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies.
Last year, the DoD's Minerva Initiative funded a project to determine 'Who Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?'
Twitter posts and conversations will be examined "to identify individuals mobilised in a social contagion and when they become mobilised."

U.S. utilities face up to $48B revenue loss from solar, efficiencyThat measure, passed in 2008, offered a 30% tax credit for residential and business installations for solar energy.
Accenture conducted telephone interviews with 85 utility executives from 20 countries between July and October.
The vast majority (79%) of utility executives said that it won't be cost-effective for consumers to go off-grid without subsidies until 2030 or beyond.
The sharp decline in solar energy costs is the result of increased economies of scale leading to cheaper photovoltaic panels, new leasing models and declining installation costs, according to Shah.
Energy utilities face losing between $18 billion and $48 billion a year in the U.S and up to €61 billion a year in Europe by 2025 as solar power and energy conservation initiatives grow, according to Accenture.

By his own account Monteilh got into undercover work after meeting a group of off-duty cops working out in a gym.
This is when suspects carry out or plot fake terrorist "attacks" at the request or under the close supervision of an FBI undercover operation using secret informants.
But that fact alone goes to the heart of the FBI's use of such confidential informants in investigating Muslim communities.
Secondly, they could also use any information Monteilh discovered – like an affair or someone being gay – to turn targeted people into becoming FBI informants themselves.

NYC Neighborhood Hit Hard by Superstorm Sandy Would Rather Sell Than RebuildThe buyout program would ensure that the land remains "vacant in perpetuity," said New York state officials.
While Superstorm Sandy's devastation along the New York and New Jersey coastlines six months ago led to enthusiastic calls to rebuild, one Staten Island neighborhood has chosen a different course: sell.
Andrew Cuomo offered to pay Oakwood Beach residents 100 percent of their homes' value before the storm hit, plus a 5 percent bonus if the residents stayed in Richmond County.
"There are some parcels that Mother Nature owns," Cuomo said in his annual State of the State address this year.
Farrell said that both approaches, from rebuilding in New Jersey to razing homes in Staten Island, could work if done right.

Syrian Walaa Alrehawi Arrested at Texas Border, Charged With Misusing U.S. PassportPresident Obama said the White House will let in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees.
Walaa Alrehawi, 27, was detained after border officials in the Rio Grande town of Hidalgo became suspicious, according to court documents.

He then berated Ms Jones when she finally told him she was HIV positive.
The marijuana charge against Ms Jones was eventually dropped.
During a routine traffic stop, Lacey discovered medical marijuana in the woman’s car, along with an expired medical marijuana card.

Exxon's own modeling research confirmed this and the company's results were later published in at least three peer-reviewed science articles.

"Happy Birthday" Copyright Ruled to Be InvalidThe "Happy Birthday" song dates to late 19th century work by a schoolteacher named Patty Smith Hill and her sister Mildred Hill.
According to the opinion on Tuesday from U.S. District Judge George H. King, "Because Summy Co. never acquired the rights to the Happy Birthday lyrics, Defendants, as Summy Co.’s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics."
Later, copyright registrations were made by Sumny's company on "Happy Birthday."
The world's most popular English-language song is potentially free from copyright after a federal judge ruled on Tuesday that filmmakers challenging Warner/Chappell Music's hold on "Happy Birthday to You" should be granted summary judgment.
The Hill sisters later assigned rights to a publishing company owned by Clayton Summy.

Watchdog questions spending at Fannie, Freddie – USATODAY.comWASHINGTON – A U.S. government watchdog is questioning $600,000 that taxpayer-funded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent on an October convention, according to a report released Thursday.
Fannie and Freddie sent about 90 employees to the Mortgage Bankers Association Annual Convention and Exposition at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago in early October.
Taxpayers have spent more than $150 billion to rescue Fannie and Freddie, the most expensive bailout of the 2008 financial crisis.
FHFA, the government regulator overseeing the two firms, sent Fannie and Freddie a letter in December stating that all expenses be "consistent with the direction and goals" of the government conservatorship.
The Inspector General for the Federal Housing Finance Agency says about half of the spending was "of questionable value."

After receiving complaints from Costa Ricans living in Sweden, Costa Rica lodged a diplomatic protest, calling the use of its national anthem a "grave disrespect to our national symbol".
Edholm said producers picked the tune from a music library because it was "beautiful and grand" but were unaware it was Costa Rica's national anthem.
"It's outrageous to use a national anthem as background music."

"Oracle sold the State of Oregon a lie."On the contrary, on August 8, 2014, Oracle filed a lawsuit riddled with false and irrelevant allegations against Cover Oregon, claiming that Cover Oregon owes Oracle an additional $23,000,000 for the "Oracle Solution" that never worked," it said.
"Oracle sold the State of Oregon a lie," it says.
"In effect, Oracle used its purported superior expertise, coupled with lies and pressing deadlines, to trap the State and Cover Oregon in a deadly spiral: at each juncture Oracle charged more and Oregon got less," the lawsuit said.
RELATED:Oregon and Oracle say each other killed Cover OregonIn total, Oracle's false claims cost the state an "extraordinary" $240,280,008, Rosenblum said.
Meanwhile, Oracle has filed its own lawsuit in federal court against Cover Oregon.

'True Blood' town evacuated after 6 million pounds of explosives foundPolice have evacuated a town in northwest Louisiana while they move out around 6 million pounds of illegally stored explosives.
The material should have been housed in a bunker approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and registered with the Louisiana State Police explosives division.
Police and Explo employees have moved just under 1 million pounds of the explosives into 18-wheelers, and have segregated another 250,000 pounds of the material for future removal, KTAL reported late Sunday.
Louisiana State Police via AP This photo released by the Louisiana State Police shows piles of explosive powder that were found by authorities at the Camp Minden industrial site in Doyline, La.
Authorities moved to evacuate the town of its remaining residents Sunday after discovering up to six times more M6 artillery propellant -- 6 million pounds -- at the site, according to NBC station KTAL in Shreveport.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/world/emissions-of-carbon-dioxide-hit-record-in-2011-researchers-say.html
Carbon Dioxide Emissions Hit Record in 2011, Researchers SayGlobal emissions of carbon dioxide were at a record high in 2011 and are likely to take a similar jump in 2012, scientists reported Sunday — the latest indication that efforts to limit such emissions are failing.
Over all, global emissions jumped 3 percent in 2011 and are expected to jump 2.6 percent in 2012, researchers reported in two papers released by scientific journals on Sunday.
Emissions continue to grow so rapidly that an international goal of limiting the ultimate warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, established three years ago, is on the verge of becoming unattainable, said researchers affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.
That apparently reflects a combination of economic weakness, the transfer of some manufacturing to developing countries and conscious efforts to limit emissions, like the renewable power targets that many American states have set.
Further increases in carbon dioxide are likely to have a profound effect on climate, scientists say, leading to higher seas and greater coastal flooding, more intense weather disasters like droughts and heat waves, and an extreme acidification of the ocean.

Low-Wage Jobs Cause More Problems Than They SolveIt also finds that, since low-wage jobs often have inflexible schedules, parents working in low-wage jobs are often denied time with their children and therefore miss critical opportunities to encourage and support them.
Now a new study by researchers at Boston College and the University of Massachusetts shows the impact of parents' low-wage jobs on their children.
Low-wage work is often judged as low-skill work, and the obvious solution is to get training and to get a better job.
According to the Boston College study, youth in low-wage families are more likely to drop out of school.
Analyzing over 100 different data sources, the new study, How Youth Are Put At Risk by Parents' Low-Wage Jobs, estimates that nearly 16 million U.S. families are headed by parents working low-wage jobs and that 1 in 6 adolescents alone live in such households.

Male model convicted in grisly murder of Portuguese TV journalistNow, almost two years later, a New York jury has convicted model Renato Seabra of the grisly second-degree murder of Carlos Antonio De Castro in their InterContinental Hotel room in Times Square.
Previously on CNN.com: Model indicted in killing of Portuguese journalistA television journalist, Castro had also been a recent gossip columnist for the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha.
Castro was found bludgeoned and castrated in the hotel room in January 2011, a law enforcement source told CNN at the time.
Seabra, now 23, attacked Castro because he was angry that Castro had ended their relationship, prosecutors said.
"This was a brutal and sadistic crime, where Renato Seabra bludgeoned, choked, and mutilated his victim before murdering him," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said following Friday's verdict.

Fearing Drug Cartels, Reporters in Mexico RetreatBut so is everybody else.”PhotoWhen they are not issuing threats, journalists say, the drug runners are buying off reporters with everything from cash to romps with prostitutes.
Rival drug gangs in recent years have fought over territory in Acapulco, where any resurgence in violence could hurt the tourism industry.
In the weeks that followed, fierce shootouts broke out along long stretches of the border, and the local reporters went silent.
Traffickers have gone after the media with a vengeance in these strategic border towns where drugs are smuggled across by the ton.
More violence flared later on Saturday in Guerrero State, with Mexican soldiers exchanging fire with gunmen, the newspaper Reforma reported.

Doubling of maternal deaths in U.S. 'scandalous,' rights group saysMedical professionals and researchers note that although the percentage of maternal deaths is increasing, the overall number still remains low.
"Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors.
The report, "Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA," notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the United States than in 40 other countries, including virtually all industrialized nations.
In 2008, 64 million people were living in "shortage areas" for primary care, Amnesty International said.
"This country's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful," said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA.

Since reporting the questionable past of runaway Toyota Prius driver James Sikes there's been a deluge of tips coming in about his character, including the following from a former business partner who alleges Sikes stole from their company.
Disagreement over the business finances wasn't the only issue Sweet had with Sikes as he echoed reports of mysterious thefts involving Sikes and claims his former partner stole office supplies.
He claims to have not had contact with his former partner since 1999 and was immediately skeptical when he saw Sikes on television.
William Sweet says he went into business with Sikes, together opening up a paralegal services company called "AAA California Aid" in 1997.

"He cannot talk right now, and that is because the fracture is right on the speech center of his brain," said Shannon.
He was hit in the forehead in downtown Oakland on Tuesday evening, after marching with fellow demonstrators to protest the closure of an Occupy Oakland camp in the city.
A spokesman for Highland General Hospital confirmed Olsen could not talk, but said he "understands everything" doctors and family are saying.
Olsen was "really happy" to see his family, Shannon added.

Assemblywoman Mary Hayashi charged with shoplifting at Neiman MarcusHayashi, 45, who has served in the Assembly since 2006 — and is married to Alameda Superior Court Judge Dennis Hayashi — was arraigned Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court.
Democratic Assemblywoman Mary Hayashi of Castro Valley has been charged with felony grand theft after being caught on video surveillance allegedly shoplifting more than $2,000 worth of merchandise from San Francisco’s Neiman Marcus store on Union Square, prosecutors say.
Hayashi was questioned by police at the Tenderloin Station and eventually booked at the County Jail on one count of felony theft.
Hayashi spokesman Sam Singer called the assemblywoman’s arrest a mistake, saying she had walked out of the store with the items unintentionally and intended to go back.
Hayashi was born in South Korea and was the first Korean American woman to be elected to the state Legislature, according to her legislative biography.

Who Was Flying the Mysterious, Drug-Filled Ghost Plane Found in Texas?The small private airport in Brookshire, Texas, doesn't have a control tower and the small two-engine prop plane (not pictured!)
Drug runners, probably coming from Mexico, crashed the plane in an emergency landing then hightailed it into the woods before the police could arrive.
A small plane skidded off a runway at an airport near Houston last night, but when police arrived on the scene to conduct a rescue they found a damaged aircraft filled with marijuana and no pilot.
The plane's landing gear was damaged, but it's not clear if that happened as a result of the rough landing or if the plane was forced down because of the damage.
Police say they have no idea where the plane came from or who the drugs belong to, but police say it was "a lot more than just personal use."

Greg King said he was satisfied by the deal reached with his son's killer, given the "unpredictability of juries."

The Obama administration announced it was naming Iran’s central bank a “primary money laundering concern” amid mounting international pressure against Iran.
Britain, France, and Canada also announce steps in wake of UN report citing 'deep concern' over Iran's nuclear program.

If not, they will land elsewhere and the French troops will be flown into Mali on smaller aircraft.

Some top U.S. military officials warn aggressive action is needed.

A New York suburban newspaper that came under criticism for publishing the names and addresses of pistol-permit holders has decided to remove the map from its web site, according to a spokesman for the publication.
The newspaper immediately faced a barrage of criticism from gun-owner advocates.

Corbett planning new assault on state stores — NewsWorks"When that's translated to wine, we would have more more than 6,600 wine stores to choose from."
Polls: Most Pennsylvanians favor privatizationMadonna says polling consistently shows most Pennsylvanians favor privatization of liquor sales, but they aren't as passionate about it as opponents.
Currently there are a little more than 600 state stores for all of Pennsylvania.
But there's one strong incentive for the state to limit the number of wine and liquor outlets that are permitted, even if the state stores are abolished: money.
Young has fought the privatization battle before, and said he expects to soon see a supposedly independent coalition of people formed to abolish state stores.

US Ninth Circuit says forensic laptop searches at the border without suspicion are unconstitionalSo it's still a border search, but that border search requires a 4th Amendment analysis, according to the court.
The judges also note that the prevalence of cloud computing means that searching at the border gives cops access to servers located all over the world.
An en banc ( all the 11/20 judges together) decision from the 9th Circuit has affirmed that you have the right to expect that your laptop and other devices will not be forensically examined without suspicion at the US border.
They note that the location of the search is meaningless to this analysis (the actual search happened 170 miles inside the country after the laptop was sent by border agents to somewhere else for analysis).
It's the first time that a US court has upheld electronic privacy rights at the border, and the court also said that using an encrypted device that can't be casually searched is not grounds for suspicion.

Nigerian extremists claim they killed 7 hostagesThe message, posted to an Islamic extremist website Saturday, said Ansaru members killed the hostages after British warplanes were seen in Bauchi, in the country's north, by Nigerian journalists.
"As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed," the group said in the statement.
Boko Haram group earlier claimed the kidnapping in December of a French national working on a renewable energy project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state.
In January 2013, Ansaru declared itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main terrorist group, analysts say.
The men were held for months, before their captors killed them in March 2012 them during a failed Nigerian military raid backed up by British special forces in Sokoto, the main city in Nigeria's northwest.

"This summer it's very important to wear lots of mosquito repellent if you don't want to get bitten by the galinipper," Pelaez said.
The female galinipper (Psorophora ciliata), a very large mosquito with hairy legs, feeds day and night and are common in Florida.
It's about 20 times bigger than the sort of typical, Florida mosquito that you find," says Anthony Pelaez of the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa.
Being bitten by a galinipper "feels like you're being stabbed," said Pelaez, who has been bitten countless times by the galinipper while working for several years in the Amazon.

Kerry meets with family of ex-FBI agent who disappeared in IranREUTERS/Jacquelyn Martin/PoolWASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday met with the family of a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007, and urged anyone who may have information about his whereabouts to come forward.
"A husband and father to seven children, Mr. Levinson has missed birthdays, anniversaries, weddings and other important milestones since his disappearance six years ago from Iran's Kish Island.
"I met with Mr. Levinson's wife and son today to reiterate that the U.S. government remains committed to locating Mr. Levinson and reuniting him safely with his family," Kerry said in a statement.
Levinson's family refers to him as a hostage and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in 2011 there were indications he was being held in Southwest Asia.
He added that the Iranian government has previously offered assistance in locating Levinson.

Congress in a race with states to pass online gambling lawTo date, proposed federal legislation has sought only to regulate Internet poker and prohibit other forms of online gambling.
REUTERS/Katoly ArvaiLOS ANGELES States racing to legalize online gambling may soon be overtaken by the federal government, as efforts to pass a national bill begin to come together.
An Illinois senate committee filed a bill earlier this week that could authorize online gambling there.
"I think the states' passage gives some incentive to the federal government to act," said Representative Joe Barton (R-Texas), who introduced an online poker bill in 2011 that failed.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation on February 27 authorizing online gambling in an attempt to help the state's struggling casino industry and generate casino tax revenues.

Guns in US schools: South Dakota votes to allow teachers to be armed in wake of Sandy Hook massacreSouth Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard signed a bill yesterday allowing the state's school districts to arm teachers and other personnel with guns.
The measure does not force a district to arm its teachers and would not force teachers to carry a gun.
Another Senate amendment allowed school district residents to push a school board's decision to a public vote.
Several representatives of school boards, school administrators and teachers opposed the bill during committee testimony last month.
On Monday, the South Dakota House voted 40-19 to accept the Senate version of the bill, which added a requirement that a school district must decide in a public meeting whether to arm teachers and others.

Russian scientists may have found new life under Antarctic iceREUTERS/Alexey Ekaikin/HandoutMOSCOW Russian scientists believe they have discovered new life forms sealed off for millions of years in a subglacial lake deep under the Antarctic ice, the RIA news agency reported on Thursday.
Scientists say the icy darkness of Lake Vostok, under some 12,139 feet of ice, may provide a glimpse of the planet before the Ice Age and clues to life on other planets.
But Bulat told RIA that scientists are waiting for more samples from the lake to confirm their discovery.
It's degree of similarity was less than 86 percent," Bulat told RIA.
Scientists from the United States and Britain are close on Moscow's heels to probe what life may exist in one of the most extreme environments on Earth.

Judge William Carpenter found Dr. Earl Bradley, of Lewes, Delaware, guilty of 24 counts of rape, sexual assault and sexual exploitation in the non-jury trial in Sussex County, Delaware Superior Court.
The doctor made 86 videotapes of the attacks, using tiny hidden cameras, according to testimony by state police who investigated the case.
The doctor faces life in prison without the possibility of parole at his August 26 sentencing.
Police who testified in the one-day trial said Bradley preferred nonverbal toddlers as his victims and that their average age was just over 3-years-old.

Sheriff Saves $1 Million By De-Privatizing County JailIt turns out that de-privatizing the jail has actually saved Hernando County taxpayers more than $1,000,000 this year.
Privatization has nothing to do with saving money and everything to do with giving kickbacks to politically connected contractors like Corrections Corporation of America:Sheriff Michael Page of Hernando County, Florida, is the latest in a line of Sheriffs to inherit the headache that is the county jail.
The county took over the facility a little more than a year ago and started the long process of upgrading the security, staff, and conditions of the jail.
Initial projections by then-Sheriff Richard Nugent hypothesized that the county could save up to $200,000 compared to what CCA would have charged.
Maybe Ric Scott and JD Alexander ought to reconsider their bullheaded push to privatize half the state’s prison system.

Deputies were called to Moskos' neighbor's house at 219 Miller Road around 8:40 p.m. Friday in reference to an alleged domestic dispute.
The caller told authorities that Moskos came to the house searching for his wife, who had sought refuge with the neighbors – a man and woman.
Moskos shot through the neighbor's front door as his wife hid in a closet, and the man and woman hid in a bedroom and the kitchen, authorities said.
Moskos' gun went off during the confrontation, causing a minor wound to the neighbor's hand, authorities said.

At least four bodies were found earlier Saturday, one day after the plane went missing.
The plane tried to land twice before losing contact, Allamand told reporters Friday.
Two of the bodies recovered were female and two were male, government spokesman Andres Chadwick told reporters.
TVN quoted him as saying he was almost certain the plane had crashed because of the number of items recovered.

He told a BND team he had helped run a secret Iraqi program to produce biological weapons, records show.
"I never said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, never in my whole life," he said.
Latif also denied that anyone produced biological weapons at the plant where he worked with Alwan.
He claimed, for example, that the son of his former boss, Basil Latif, secretly headed a vast weapons of mass destruction procurement and smuggling scheme from England.

Cops Missed Bodies in Double Murder CaseSutton was testifying in the double-murder trial of 29-year-old Neil Entwistle, who is accused of killing his wife, 27-year-old Rachel Entwistle and 9-month-old baby, Lillian, before fleeing to his native England.
I looked to the right of the baby's face and saw a woman's face," said Sutton.
Mary Ritchie of State Police Crime Scene Services described in excruciating detail the wounds she found on the victims' bodies.
When investigators rolled Rachel onto her back they noticed "a puncture wound to her left breast."
Sutton said he performed a "well-being" check on the house and "nothing looked out of the ordinary."

Abuse case began with a tipAbuse case began with a tipThe mother of a boy, 5, and her girlfriend are arrested after the child is found to be the victim of severe abuse.
For two years, authorities said, a mother subjected her son to what veteran detectives described as shocking, ritualistic abuse.
"It causes you to question the humanity of some people," Assistant Police Chief Earl Paysinger said about the abuse.
Officials got word of the boy's condition as they were interviewing Brown and Matthews and began asking more pointed questions and challenging the pair's story, Lizarraga said.
On Monday, June 9, Brown and her live-in girlfriend, Krystal Matthews, 19, were ordered to a children services office along with the boy to discuss the allegation of abuse.

AP sets up a toll booth for bloggers citing its storiesIf a blogger cites a rewritten but credited AP piece, whom does he owe, the AP or the newspaper or online service that rewrote the AP?
For instance: Suppose a news source holds a press conference, and makes a statement to several attendees including an AP correspondent.
The pricing scale for excerpting AP content begins at $12.50 for 5-25 words and goes as high as $100 for 251 words and up.
Does the citation of that quote count as an excerpt of an AP story?
If the AP runs a story with this phrase, will it therefore cost anyone else $12.50 to use this 10 cent expression?

Can the Enemy Build a Super-Soldier?In the inaugural edition of the Pentagon's annual Soviet Military Power booklet, published in 1981, then Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned: "There is nothing hypothetical about the Soviet military machine.
Or enemy soldiers with hardware implanted in their brains that makes them better able to target U.S. troops than U.S. troops are able to target them.
A newly uncovered report suggests that foreign powers could someday create a supersoldier, perhaps like Dolph Lundgren in Universal Soldier.
"Little is known about the present activities of adversaries in using/developing human performance modifiers," the report says.
Today's equivalent of Weinberger's Soviet Military Power booklet is titled simply Human Performance, and it was written by the JASONs, a band of top scientists that advises the Defense Department.

Iran's Supreme Leader vows no change in U.S. relationsStory highlights Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei says Iran will not shift its policies toward the "arrogant" United StatesThe nuclear deal agreed in the past week was an exception because it was in Iran's interest, he says(CNN) Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed Saturday that a newly negotiated deal on his country's nuclear program would not alter Iran's policies toward the United States.
Khamenei said the negotiations with the United States and other world powers on Tehran's nuclear program were an exception because they served Iran's national interest.
"Our policies toward the arrogant government of the United States will not be changed at all," he said.
In a televised address marking the start of Eid al-Fitr, the festival that follows the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Khamenei said the agreement signed Tuesday on the nuclear issue would not affect Iran's stance on other regional or bilateral matters.

Abbott orders Texas National Guard to carry guns at military facilitiesAbbott said in a release Saturday that he will authorize Adjutant General John Nichols of the Texas National Guard to arm National Guard personnel at military facilities across Texas.
Abbott's move followed shootings on two military facilities in Chattanooga, Tenn.“It is with a heavy heart that I issue this order,” he said.
Greg Abbott says he is reluctantly asking Texas Military Forces to arm soldiers at their home bases after Thursday's attacks at military sites in Tennessee that killed four Marines and one sailor.
The Republican governor said the Chattanooga events made “clear that our military personnel must have the ability to defend themselves against these type of attacks on our own soil.
However, they initially reported no success at finding such evidence.

But attorneys for Rolling Stone deny that the magazine libeled Eramo, noting that the account also highlighted that she is seen as an asset to the community of rape survivors on campus.
Her lawsuit focuses on last fall’s 9,000-word exposé, “A Rape on Campus,” by journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely.

Drones Delayed North Fire Response: OfficialsOfficials said several drones delayed aerial firefighting efforts deployed to the so-called North Fire on Friday.
Two drones actually gave chase to air units, and the incident delayed response by about 15 to 20 minutes, according to Battalion Chief Marc Peebles of San Bernardino County Fire Department.
(Published Saturday, July 18, 2015)Drones forced the landing of planes deployed to fight the so-called North Fire in southern California that burned cars and homes along the 15 Freeway Friday, delaying response to the frightening blaze, officials said.
The drones can pose a hazard to the planes, so the airspace must be closed to fixed-wing aircraft if they are seen in the air.
They can strike one of these things and one of our aircraft could go down, killing the firefighters in the air.

The FAA and local law enforcement may genuinely fear for the safety of their own aircraft.
As sporadic violence and looting continues overnight in Ferguson, MO, the FAA has issued flight restrictions over the St. Louis area, offering only "to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities" as a reason for the flight ban.
"But they were a little concerned of, obviously, anything else that could be going on.

The state also had only a couple of abortion providers, and has the nation's highest teen birth rate.
Mississippi had the lowest abortion rate, at 4 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age.

Obama orders US to draw up overseas target list for cyber-attacksBarack Obama has ordered his senior national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks, a top secret presidential directive obtained by the Guardian reveals.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, identified cyber threats in general as the top national security threat.
But it also makes clear how both offensive and defensive cyber operations are central to US strategy.
Obama further authorized the use of offensive cyber attacks in foreign nations without their government's consent whenever "US national interests and equities" require such nonconsensual attacks.
The directive makes multiple references to the use of offensive cyber attacks by the US military.

According to the Coloradan, a group of county commissioners are pursuing a plan to secede from Colorado over concerns that their voices are being ignored by the state.

Slain cartel leader was U.S. informant - US news - Crime & courtsBut El Paso police said Gonzalez was a lieutenant in the Juarez cartel, which traffics in marijuana, cocaine and heroin.
The family hasn't been seen since the shooting, although El Paso police spokesman Javier Sambrano said investigators are in contact with them.
But while in El Paso, Valderrabano said, Gonzalez and his family were very pleasant.
Valderrabano said Solis told him the family was from Villa Ahumada, Mexico, a small town south of Ciudad Juarez that has been virtually taken over by cartel fighters in recent months.
The cartel was once among the most dangerous in Mexico, but has recently lost some standing because of arrests, deaths and infighting.

Collective Bargaining Can Help Lower DeficitsIN Ohio, Wisconsin and other states facing budget deficits, some elected officials assert that closing those gaps requires achieving labor savings and weakening labor unions.
Correcting this imbalance is not easy, but in a growing number of states, budget deficits are being used to justify efforts to scale back not only labor costs, but labor rights.
The mayor cannot directly discuss pension benefits as part of contract negotiations with unions, even though pension benefits could be as much as 80 percent of an employee’s overall compensation.
In New York City, taxpayers will be forced to pay $8.3 billion in pension costs this year, up from $1.5 billion 10 years ago.
To the extent that collective bargaining agreements or state laws are no longer serving the public, we should change them.

Some angry Texans are stuck south of the barrierCOLUMN ONE Some angry Texans are stuck south of the barrierIn and around Brownsville, Rio Grande farms, pastures and even some homes end up on the 'Mexican' side of the new Homeland Security fence.
The Homeland Security Department last year put up a tall steel barrier across the fields from Taylor's home.
Still, there was some comfort in knowing that, on the map anyway, the Rio Grande marked the international boundary.
When the Homeland Security Department began its Southwest border buildup four years ago, erecting barriers seemed a straightforward enough proposition.
The Rio Grande twists through Brownsville and surrounding areas, and planners had to avoid building on the flood plain.

Ms. Thompson learned of it and told Major Hasan about it that night, and though he called the police, Major Hasan did not appear to be angered by it.
Mr. Hasan attended the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., when Anwar Al-Awlaki was the imam there, but it is not clear what influence Mr. Awlaki’s rhetoric may have had on Mr. Hasan.
One of Major Hasan’s supervisors, Dr. Thomas Grieger, said Major Hasan had difficulties while at Walter Reed that required counseling.

Fate of Same-Sex Marriage Bill in Albany UnclearDavid A. Paterson has called legislators to Albany on Tuesday and asked them to pass a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
Jon S. Corzine’s defeat in New Jersey has complicated efforts to legalize same-sex marriage there.
The Maine referendum, in which voters reversed lawmakers’ earlier approval of same-sex marriage, was not the only cause for concern for supporters of the bill.
“We will never be assured in the State Senate — waiting for that is like waiting for Godot,” he said.
Senator Rubén Díaz Sr., a Pentecostal minister and Bronx Democrat who is the most outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage in the Legislature, said last week that the issue should be voted on during an election year.

That's led to a kind of parlor game where industry observers have speculated about what patents Microsoft might be holding over Android.
The patent system is supposed to create that "public notice" on its own, but it's sorely lacking.
Notably, both the SEP section and the Android-specific section include patents that Microsoft apparently acquired when it participated in the Rockstar bid.
In fact, the English-language version of the MOFCOM site about the merger doesn't have the patent lists.

Kucinich took the gavel of a subcommittee examining the financial bailouts, finding kindred spirits among some of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers.
With most attention focused on the state’s GOP presidential primary battle, and no Democratic primary for president, Kucinich was left in a low-turnout race in a newly drawn district against his once-close ally, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).
Often coming up on the short end of his fights, Kucinich, 65, never stopped swing­ing but usually did so in a friendly spirit.
After his reelection defeat, Kucinich entered a period of political exile, reemerging in 1996 to win the House seat representing the western end of Cleveland and its suburbs.

Why newspapers are failing « GrokSurf's San DiegoBill Wyman has written an outstanding analysis of the state of the newspaper industry in his article Five Key Reasons Why Newspapers Are Failing.
He advocates more of what is only now being realized: newspapers need to become the focal point for all local issues, not just print occasional hard-hitting local stories.
In describing the economic/business reasons for newspapers’ decline, he reserves some criticism for management, editors, and writers alike for having avoided building an effective online presence.
Otherwise, I consider Wyman’s piece to be necessary and worthwhile reading for anybody who thinks about the survival of newspapers in an internet-based information age.
I’ve found that some newspapers already do this and consequently had trouble finding a particular story because the citation I had was a headline from the print version while the online version had a different headline.

The five are currently charged before a military commission proceeding at Guantanamo Bay prison that was suspended as the Obama administration considered where to try them.
The decision to try the five 9/11 suspects in federal court rather than military commissions is smart counter-terrorism strategy, Massimino added.
And eventually, when the 9/11 plotters are finally brought to justice in federal court, Greg will deserve a portion of the credit.”Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.
"The policy on Guantanamo that Obama inherited was a complete mess—legally, practically, and every which way," Massimino said.

Fort Hood suspect 'is paralysed'Maj Nidal Malik Hasan's paralysis could be permanent, his lawyer says The US Army psychiatrist accused of murdering 13 people at Fort Hood is paralysed, his lawyer says.
Police shot Maj Hasan four times, ending the gunman's rampage through the base after an hour and a half.
He will ask the military court to appoint an additional military lawyer and a civilian investigator to work with him, he said.
Lawyer John Galligan told reporters his client had no feeling in his legs and doctors had told him the condition may be permanent.
Meanwhile, doubts have emerged over who exactly fired the shots that brought down Maj Hasan.

UPDATE 2-Google, Authors try to answer book deal concernsUnder the new deal, unclaimed funds will eventually go to charities.
INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIONSAs part of the amended deal, books in the registry would be reduced to those copyrighted in the United States or published in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.
There had been significant international objection to the deal on the grounds that non-English speaking authors, in particular, were represented by the authors and publishers who sued Google but had no say in negotiating the deal.
On Oct. 22, a group representing authors in China accused Google of copyright infringement.
Dan Clancy, architect of the Google program, said the search giant would reach out to authors' groups overseas.

Detroit job fair draws thousandsDetroit job fair draws thousandsBy Naomi Spencer14 November 2009Thousands of Detroit area residents lined up downtown Friday at a jobs fair, waiting in long lines to apply for some 400 positions.
In March, the city sponsored a similar job fair, which attracted as many as 10,000 residents.
Officials from the Detroit Workforce Development Department, Neighborhood Legal Services Michigan, and Mayor David Bing’s office told the WSWS the fair was a joint effort to create job opportunities in Detroit.
Wal-Mart offered 300 job openings, which applicants told WSWS reporters were mainly entry-level part-time and temporary work (see accompanying video).
“It’s a waste of time,” Movita Gresham told WSWS reporters as she exited the conference hall.

Another Debt Crisis Is Brewing, This One in Student LoansThe Project on Student Debt, a research and advocacy organization in Oakland, Calif., used federal data to estimate that 206,000 people graduated from college (including many from for-profit universities) with more than $40,000 in student loan debt in that same period.
According to the College Board’s Trends in Student Aid study, 10 percent of people who graduated in 2007-8 with student loans had borrowed $40,000 or more.
It would be difficult in any event because federal bankruptcy law makes it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debts.
“Aid administrators want to keep their jobs,” said Joan H. Crissman, interim president and chief executive of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.
Rent runs $750, and the full monthly payments on her student loans would be about $700 if they weren’t being deferred, which would not leave a lot left over.

Little Headway Made as BP Struggles to Halt Oil LeakHOUSTON — BP engineers struggled Friday to plug a gushing oil well a mile under the sea, but as of late in the day they had made little headway in stemming the flow.
For the second day, public statements early in the day from BP and government officials seemed to suggest progress.
They cannot use brute force because they risk making the leak worse if they damage the pipes leading down to the well.
Later in the day, they acknowledged that the effort was no closer to succeeding than when they started.
There are not going to be silver bullets or perfect answers.”Nor were there perfect answers Friday about the status of the top kill effort.

A day after scientists reported finding a huge "plume" of oil extending miles east of the leaking BP well, on Friday a Louisiana scientist said his crew had located another vast plume of oily globs, miles in the opposite direction.
Trying to find the edges of the plume, he said the submarine traveled miles from side to side.
Cowan said that the submarine traveled about 400 feet down, close to the sea floor, and found oil all the way down.
Already, scientists and officials in Louisiana have reported finding thick oil washing ashore despite the presence of floating booms.

Shia LaBeouf Arrested — Actor Allegedly Drunk & Out Of Control In AustinHollywood bad boy Shia LaBeouf, 29, was allegedly arrested in Austin, Texas on Oct. 9.
A witness says he was allegedly drunk and out of control, while disobeying police, a new report claims.
This time, Shia was reportedly arrested for being extremely drunk and jaywalking.
Just one year after getting arrested in NYC for having an outburst outside a Broadway theater, the ‘Transformers’ actor was detained by police Oct. 9.
Shia said he slapped and “grabbed” Alan because he wanted the “party” in his “pants.” We’re not exactly sure what that means, but Shia was arrested for doing it.

University of Phoenix barred from recruiting military studentsLast financial year, 9,282 members of the U.S. military attended the university through the department's tuition assistance program, she added.
The tuition assistance program provides educational assistance to active duty military members.
(Reuters) - For-profit college operator Apollo Education Group Inc said the U.S. Department of Defense has placed its University of Phoenix on probation, barring the unit from recruiting students on military bases or using federal money to fund tuition.
The University of Phoenix represented 87 percent of Apollo's total net revenue in 2014 and had more than 230,000 enrolled students.
No new or transfer students will receive tuition assistance at the university on probation, said Dawn Bilodeau, head of the DOD's department that oversees voluntary education.

“July 1st and 2nd, in a standard briefing to a commander of his unit, Fourth Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, we have tapes of Taliban talking on Bergdahl’s phone saying that Bergdahl wanted to join them.
“What they heard was the Taliban on Bergdahl’s phone because he had joined them by then.
Lawyers for the soldier also have started demanding the military release a report on Bergdahl by Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, who had told a hearing he didn’t think Bergdahl deserved jail time.

“The relationship and tension between protest and property destruction is something that America has grappled with since the Revolutionary War & the Boston Tea Party,” he told Fox via Twitter.

Scott "wasn't satisfied" with how the information was used when the law was first passed, but is hopeful things will be different now.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a sponsor, said the law "will give the information needed to strengthen trust at every level."

The first time the bill was passed, it took years for data to start coming in, and it expired shortly thereafter, Scott said.

References to Britain’s intelligence agencies were deleted at their request from the damning US report on the CIA’s use of torture after 9/11, it has emerged.
There is no reference at all in the Senate’s 500-page summary report to UK intelligence agencies or the British territory of Diego Garcia used by the US as a military base.
However, on Thursday, the prime minister’s deputy official spokesman said: “My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition.
But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary.

Comedian Bill Cosby won't be charged over molestation claimLOS ANGELES - Los Angeles prosecutors have declined to file any charges against Bill Cosby after a woman recently reported the comedian molested her around 1974.
RELATED: Woman accuses comedian Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting her when she was 15 years oldHuth has accused Cosby in a civil lawsuit of forcing her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 years old.
Cosby's attorney said that Huth attempted to extort $250,000 from the comedian before she sued.
The rejection of a child sexual abuse charge by prosecutors on Tuesday comes roughly 10 days after the woman, Judy Huth, met with police detectives.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office rejected filing a misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 because the statute of limitations had passed.

Russia and the West are at loggerheads over the conflict in east Ukraine where fighting between Kiev government troops and pro-Russian separatists has killed more than 4,700 people since mid-April.
Russia, which denies military involvement in east Ukraine despite mounting evidence on the ground, says Kiev must negotiate with the rebels and reform Ukraine's constitution to give Donbass more autonomy within Ukraine.
"In recent weeks discussing providing... lethal arms to Ukraine intensified in a worrisome way," Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency, in comments on the crisis in the industrial Donbass region of east Ukraine.

McDonald's Japan running out of french friesMcDonald’s Japan is only selling small-size french fries because a labor dispute among ports on America’s West Coast has delayed shipments of supplies, Reuters reports.
McDonald’s Japan reportedly has not said when it would resume selling larger sizes, but Reuters points out there does not seem to be a limit on how many small-size fries customers can buy.
“Unfortunately without this sales restriction step, we would run the danger of running out of fries at some of our stores around the end of the year or beginning of the new year,” McDonald’s Japan spokeswoman Kokoro Toyama told Reuters.
To help avoid a shortage, the company is ordering shipments of frozen potatoes from East Coast ports to Japan—the biggest Asian market for frozen potatoes made in America.

But a small group of hawkish foreign policy experts  who have lobbied the White House since August to escalate U.S. involvement in Afghanistan  are christening Obama the new "War President."
U.S. President Barack Obama’s plan for a 30,000-troop surge and a troop withdrawal timeline beginning in 18 months has caught criticism from both Democrat and Republican lawmakers.

Peshawar has been a frequent target for militant attacks, and initial reports suggested it may have been another such incident.
The explosion came a day after 35 people were killed in a militant attack on a mosque near the Pakistani army's headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Investigators quoted by the Associated Press said they found no trace of explosives at the scene of the Peshawar blast.

Austria was annexed by Germany in 1938 and the use of Nazi symbols is now a crime.
The Austrian capital's public transit authority Wiener Linien said it had taken action after a report of the incident appeared in a Jewish paper.
Germany's Der Spiegel quoted the transit authority as saying the actions were "unspeakable".

Ivory auction opens amid concernsNamibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe will auction more than 100 tonnes of ivory from stockpiles to buyers from China and Japan.
By Richard BlackEnvironment correspondent, BBC News websiteConsignments of illegal ivory are still recovered leaving Africa The first officially sanctioned sale of ivory in southern Africa for almost a decade opened on Tuesday.
The ivory trade was banned globally in 1989 because poaching was decimating elephant populations.
Some environment groups say the sales encourage poachers elsewhere in Africa to kill elephants for ivory that can be fed into the illegal trade.
However, data collected by the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic shows that seizures of illegal ivory fell in the years following the last legal sale in 1999.

The arrest of Felix, 52, is a fresh setback for the Arellano Felix organisation, which, for more than two decades, has controlled the cross-border flow of narcotics into the southern US states.
"It is another very significant blow to the Arellano Felix organisation but we do know they are not completely destroyed," said David Shirk, of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute.
In 2006, in the state of Michoacan, five severed heads were thrown by gunmen on to a nightclub floor.

Said Pistole: "Sex trafficking of children remains one of the most violent and unconscionable crimes in our country."
Federal authorities rescued 47 juveniles and arrested scores of pimps as part of a wide-scale effort to crack down on child prostitution and sex trafficking rings.
He likened the rings to "21st century slavery" made easier by technology that allows customers to view Internet profiles of their victims and share images.
Using tips and informants, agents patrolled truck stops, Web sites and streets of such local cities as Alexandria, Baltimore and College Park.

The Washington Post Undercounts Iraq DeathsACTION:Ask the Washington Post to clarify its “Iraq War Casualties” feature to convey the true range of estimates of Iraqi deaths since the invasion.
And why does the paper use the misleading label “maximum count” to refer to the 96,719 deaths recorded by Iraq Body Count?
In the most recent edition of this feature (10/25/08) which the Post has been publishing as a chart in the Saturday newspaper since August 2, the Post offers a “maximum count” of 96,719 Iraqi civilian deaths.
The Washington Post‘s weekly Saturday feature on “Iraq War Casualties” has consistently listed a “maximum count” of Iraqi civilian deaths that is dramatically lower than the likely civilian death tolls assessed through surveys of the Iraqi public.
The source the Post cites for its “maximum count” of Iraqi civilian deaths is based on casualty reports from the group Iraq Body Count, which bases its figures on violent civilian deaths that are reported in media outlets and, when possible, by other NGO and official sources.

No Link Between Violent Video Games' Effects and School ShootingsThe average experimental study in this area involves having one group of people play a violent video game while another group plays a non-violent video game.
It appears that any negative effect of violent video games is dwarfed by the effects of other societal factors.
Although researchers have often noted the preference of violent video games by many school shooters, given that 97 percent of adolescents play video games such a preference is not overly surprising.
Therefore, the reasoning goes, even if violent video games are only a small contributing risk factor to violence, because so many people are exposed to such media the negative effect of violent video games at the societal level will be immense.
I am a research psychologist who has studied the negative effects of violent video games.

"We believe that our work involves the first scientific approach to establishing his current location" the research concludes.
By factoring in his need for security, electricity, high ceilings to accommodate his 6ft 4in frame and spare rooms for his bodyguards, the search can be further narrowed to three walled compounds.
Using patterns of how animal species spread, the world's most wanted terrorist can be tracked down to a town in the tribal region of North West Pakistan it is claimed.
Finally after looking at his need for electricity for dialysis, high walls, spare rooms for his entourage, and trees to hide from prying eyes, satellite pictures show just three suitable houses.

Putting Stamp on Afghan War, Obama Will Send 17,000 TroopsWASHINGTON — President Obama said Tuesday that he would send an additional 17,000 American troops to Afghanistan this spring and summer, putting his stamp firmly on a war that he has long complained is going in the wrong direction.
The order will add nearly 50 percent to the 36,000 American troops already there.
Of the 30,000 additional troops that the commanders had initially sought, some 6,000 arrived in January after being sent by President Bush.
“The president is committing these troops before he’s determined what the mission is,” said Tom Andrews, director of the coalition organization Win Without War.
A further decision on sending more troops will come after the administration completes a broader review of Afghanistan policy, White House officials said.

Thousands of teachers and other union members rallied Thursday at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles to oppose state and local cuts to education that are widely expected to result in larger classes for students as well as layoffs and more expensive healthcare.
The less-experienced teachers at risk of being laid off next fall include 24-year-old Tiffany Francis, a seventh-grade science teacher at Peary Middle School in Gardena, who attended the rally with several friends.

Judge says Polanski must appear to get rulingLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski, who has lived in exile in France since 1977, shows up in court.
Although he was involved in the early stages of the investigation, Wells was taken off the Polanski case.
But a judge denied the request, saying the director must show up in court to obtain a ruling.
But prosecutors have consistently argued that dismissing the Polanski case would be a miscarriage of justice, allowing a man who "drugged and raped a 13-year-old child" to go free.
As a director, Polanski is best known for the films "Rosemary's Baby," "Chinatown" and "The Pianist," a 2002 drama about the Holocaust that won him the Oscar for best director.

First US face transplant completeSurgeons at a clinic in a Cleveland, Ohio, have performed America's first almost-total face transplant.
The new face does not look like the donor because its shape is altered by the muscles and bones of the patient's face.
The world's first face transplant took place in France three years ago, on Isabelle Dinoire, a woman who had been mauled by her dog.
The Cleveland transplant is only the fourth to be carried out.
Altered face Doctors in Cleveland said the operation had been carried out two weeks ago and they would release more details on Wednesday.

Cheney OK'd harsh CIA tacticsCheney OK'd harsh CIA tactics"I was aware of the program, certainly, and involved in helping get the process cleared," Cheney said in an interview with ABC News.
Cheney and the Bush administration have been accused of "cherry-picking" intelligence to support going to war with Iraq.
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney said, the CIA "in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and couldn't do.
Asked whether he still believes it was appropriate to use the waterboarding method on terrorism suspects, Cheney said: "I do."
WASHINGTON — Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he was directly involved in approving severe interrogation methods used by the CIA, and that the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should remain open indefinitely.

The Mandarin Oriental was expected to be one of Beijing's most luxurious hotels, with 241 guest rooms.
The Mandarin Oriental hotel, still under construction, caught fire as the skies above the Chinese capital were filled with fireworks - part of celebrations of the lantern festival that follows the Lunar New Year.
'I think it's really sad that this building is destroyed before it can be opened to the public,' he said.
The fire destroyed years of hard work, said Erik Amir, a senior architect at OMA, who rushed to the site.

Girl starved to death after opSophie Waller refused to eat or talk after her teeth were removed An eight-year-old girl starved to death at home because she refused to open her mouth after a dental operation, an inquest heard.
She was admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital on 7 November 2005.
Sophie Waller, from St Dennis, Cornwall, was so afraid of dentists she was sent to the Royal Cornwall Hospital to have her milk teeth taken out.
A pathologist, Dr Marion Brundell, told the inquest that Sophie had died of acute renal failure from dehydration and starvation.
Her parents said that four days before Sophie's death they rang the hospital to say they were bringing her back in but were told they could not.

Judges order Calif. inmates released - US news - LifeThe administration previously said it would appeal any inmate release order to the U.S. Supreme Court.
A special panel of federal judges tentatively ruled Monday that California must release tens of thousands of inmates to relieve overcrowding.
The proposed targets would require the state to reduce the prison population by between 36,200 and 57,000 inmates.
The judges said no other solution will improve conditions so poor that inmates die regularly of suicides or lack of proper care.
“This is particularly true considering that California’s overcrowded prison system is itself ... a public safety hazard,” the panel said in its order.

Brazil mining flood could devastate environment for yearsBefore a name change in 2007, the miner was formally known as the Vale of the Rio Doce Company.
Researchers are testing the river water and results should be published over the coming weeks, giving a better idea of the contents of the mining waste.
The mouth of the Rio Doce is a nesting area for endangered sea turtles, an animal sensitive to chemical changes in the water.
According to mining industry research and scientific literature published in recent years, the compounds are commonly used at Brazilian mines, including Samarco's.
Samarco Mineração SA, a joint venture between mining giants Vale SA and BHP Billiton and owner of the mine, has repeatedly said the mud is not toxic.

He was one of three people in a car stopped by police Saturday morning, hours after the attacks that left at least 129 dead, the officials said.
Three French police officials and a top French security official confirmed all that officers stopped Abdeslam and checked his ID and then let him go.
The officials spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly disclose details of the investigation.
One of his brothers detonated a suicide vest in central Paris and another was ultimately detained in Belgium.

Now, he said, he had left ISIS as a defector—making him a marked man.
***In his first weeks with ISIS, Abu Khaled met Germans, Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Venezuelans, Trinidadians, Americans, and Russians—all freshly arrived to “remain and expand,” as the ISIS mantra goes, and to be custodians of the one true faith.
But Abu Khaled didn’t want to leave his wife and an apartment he’d just acquired in the suburbs of embattled Aleppo.
So I asked Abu Khaled: Did you warn anyone about these two?

The unlawful property in question: a Kinder Surprise egg she had bought as a gift.
Bird, a 48-year-old social-work student at the University of Manitoba, and her two sons, were caught up in a random search at the border.
The family was driving to Ontario to visit her two daughters and going through the United States, which is a shorter drive, Bird said.
Linda Bird couldn’t believe it when agents from the U.S. Border patrol at the crossing between Manitoba and Minnesota told her she had illegal contraband in her car – and that she faced the possibility of a $300 fine.

As usual in its lawsuits, Righthaven demands $150,000 in damages from both Higgins and Hoehn.
Both the madjacksports and Google sites are somewhat protected from copyright lawsuits because they have posted "DMCA" notices as required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Righthaven said Hoehn posts as "Dogs that Bark" on the website madjacksports.com, where Righthaven says that since 1999 Hoehn has posted about 18,000 items.
Prior to the Righthaven lawsuits, the Review-Journal and Denver Post generally tried to resolve copyright disputes out of court and that's still the practice of most of the newspaper industry.

Support for Abortion SlipsAmong Republicans, there has been a seven point decline in support for legal abortion and a corresponding six point increase in opposition to abortion.
For example, most people who regularly attend religious services continue to come down in opposition to abortion, while the large majority of those who rarely or never attend religious services still support legal abortion.
But the change is smaller among Democrats, whose support for legal abortion is down four points with no corresponding increase in pro-life opinion.
The decline in support for legal abortion first appeared in polls in the spring of 2009.
Nearly half of abortion opponents (47%), including 62% of those who say abortion should be illegal in all cases, say that a pro-choice view is not a respectable opinion for someone to hold.

Her son says the gunman told them not to move and fired the gun in the air.
After asking for the shoes of one of the boys, the teens reportedly called them “suckers” and ran off.

U.S. draws line on protecting CIA-backed rebels in SyriaColonel Mustafa told CBS News America left his men vulnerable by giving them too few weapons and too little ammunition.
WASHINGTON -- The Russian military intervention to prop up Syria's government has brought new scrutiny of the CIA's secret support to Syrian rebels fighting President Bashar Assad.
"He should face a military court," Colonel Mustafa told CBS News.
The CIA effort, which has trained and funded as many as 10,000 Syrian rebels over the last two years, is separate from the failed Defense Department training program that the Pentagon ended last week.
More than 550 TOW missiles have been provided to the rebels, Lister said, citing rebel sources who track the shipments.

Japan govt cuts economic assessment as output sagsJapan's government lowered its assessment of the economy on Wednesday as output sags, in a worrying sign that recovery is stalling as overseas demand weakens.
"Recently, industrial output has weakened."
"The economy is in a gradual recovery trend, but there are some pockets of weakness," the Cabinet Office said in its monthly economic report.
The government also downgraded its view of industrial production as factory activity contracts and inventories rise.
The gloomy overall assessment raises the stakes for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy meeting at the end of the month and places Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies under even greater scrutiny.

Okinawa Governor Revokes Approval for Relocation of US Air BaseLocal residents object to living with U.S. Marine Air Station Futenma and want the base moved off Okinawa.
TOKYO -- Okinawa's governor on Tuesday revoked approval for work needed to relocate a U.S. air base from one area of the southern Japanese island to another, but the Tokyo government said it would still proceed with the plan.
"I will work to keep my promise not to allow another base in Henoko," Onaga said Tuesday.
The U.S. side says it is committed to the base relocation and views it as important to the health of the U.S.-Japan security alliance.
Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga rejected Onaga's stance, saying the base must be moved for safety reasons.

“In the course of the investigation, Drumm was implicated in the alleged malpractices,” the document says.
Anglo Irish was Ireland’s third-biggest bank and its collapse forced the government to nationalise it in 2009.
The alleged offences carry sentences of between five years and life imprisonment.
The court filings show the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority filed a complaint with the Garda Síochána alleging a number of malpractices within Anglo in February 2009.

By early 2007, Goldman’s mortgage unit had become a hive of intense activity.
Their elite mortgage unit is now at the center of allegations that Goldman and Mr. Tourre, 31, defrauded investors with one of those complex deals.
During the boom, Goldman’s mortgage unit was a leader on Wall Street.
Mr. Viniar, the chief financial officer, told analysts that the mortgage unit was posting record profits because of its short bets that mortgage investments would lose value.

As in 2009, Germany is viewed most favourably while Iran and Pakistan are seen as the most negative influences.
For the first time since the annual poll began in 2005, America's influence in the world is now seen as more positive than negative.
The improved scores for the US coincided with Barack Obama becoming president, a BBC correspondent notes.
Nearly 30,000 people in 28 countries were interviewed for the poll, between November 2009 and February 2010.

He was carrying the mask and hat in a shopping bag when police approached him, according to the police department.

But the Petraeus affair is as much an outlier as an exemplar.
Based on these connections, investigators obtained a warrant to monitor other e-mail accounts Broadwell used, including a Gmail account.
Agents considered that the anonymous e-mail account used to send the harassing e-mails might have been hacked by someone else who was sending the e-mails to Kelley.
Authorities say the location data connected to the e-mails and the e-mail account from which they were sent, helped them identify the sender as Petraeus’ biographer, Paula Broadwell.

“President Obama is absolutely determined to form a [missile shield] base in Redzikowo in 2018,” said U.S.
Obama has modified the shield plan, which envisions stationing SM-3 missile interceptors in Poland, but it continues to be opposed by Russia.
Poland, one of the most pro-American countries in Europe, had looked skeptically at Obama’s efforts to “reset” relations with Moscow.
“This is a very important and symbolic moment for our relations,” said Polish Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak at an opening ceremony Friday.

Elmo Voice Actor Kevin Clash Exits Sesame Street Over Allegations of Underage Sex with Teen BoyKevin Clash, who has been the iconic voice of Elmo for the past 28 years, stands accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage teen — allegations Clash denies.
Allegations of sex with a 16-year-old boy have temporarily forced out the man responsible for voicing one of the most beloved Sesame Street characters of all time.
Though he admits to having a relationship with his accuser — now 23 — Clash told TMZ the man was of legal age at the time.
Officials at Sesame Workshop, who have met with the unidentified accuser at least twice, stand by Clash, insisting that no evidence has been produced thus far to prove the claims.
"Kevin insists that these allegations are false and defamatory and he has taken actions to protect his reputation," Workshop reps said in a statement.

With No New Jobs in August, Calls for Urgent ActionThe general unemployment rate, which counts only people who looked for work in the previous four weeks, held steady at 9.1 percent.
“As long as payrolls are weak, you will continue to hear cries of not just recession risk but cries that the United States is in a recession and we just don’t know it,” said Ellen Zentner, the senior United States economist for Nomura Securities.
August brought no increase in the number of jobs in the United States, a signal that the economy has stalled and that inaction by policy makers carries substantial risk.
Local governments lost 20,000 jobs as they continued to struggle with budget shortfalls and the disappearance of federal stimulus money.
The unemployment rate, at 9.1 percent, did not change last month, and the White House said it was expected to stay that high through at least 2012.

"I think it's appropriate that a Muslim event be recognized.

Fiesta Texas will be open to the public that day as scheduled, a spokeswoman said.
The event reflects the gradual acceptance of local Muslims, said the Rev.

Durkee also oversaw the political-action committees of the Democratic Party of Orange County and the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, among others.
Special Agent Steve Dupre of the bureau’s Sacramento office said she was arrested in connection with her position as a campaign treasurer.
Ted Lieu, D-Torrance and Curren Price, D-Los Angeles; Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Krekorian; and former Orange County lawmaker Tom Umberg.

Sheriff Saves $1 Million By De-Privatizing County JailIt turns out that de-privatizing the jail has actually saved Hernando County taxpayers more than $1,000,000 this year.
Privatization has nothing to do with saving money and everything to do with giving kickbacks to politically connected contractors like Corrections Corporation of America:Sheriff Michael Page of Hernando County, Florida, is the latest in a line of Sheriffs to inherit the headache that is the county jail.
The county took over the facility a little more than a year ago and started the long process of upgrading the security, staff, and conditions of the jail.
Initial projections by then-Sheriff Richard Nugent hypothesized that the county could save up to $200,000 compared to what CCA would have charged.
Maybe Ric Scott and JD Alexander ought to reconsider their bullheaded push to privatize half the state’s prison system.

Sniper shoots Fremont man accused of threatening wife, deputiesMoskos found the man and threatened to kill him if he didn't say where Moskos' wife was hiding, deputies said.
Deputies were called to Moskos' neighbor's house at 219 Miller Road around 8:40 p.m. Friday in reference to an alleged domestic dispute.
The caller told authorities that Moskos came to the house searching for his wife, who had sought refuge with the neighbors – a man and woman.
Moskos shot through the neighbor's front door as his wife hid in a closet, and the man and woman hid in a bedroom and the kitchen, authorities said.
Moskos' gun went off during the confrontation, causing a minor wound to the neighbor's hand, authorities said.

All 21 dead in Chilean plane crash(CNN) -- All 21 people aboard a military plane that went missing off Chile's Pacific coast, near the Juan Fernandez islands, are dead, Defense Minister Andres Allamand said Saturday.
At least four bodies were found earlier Saturday, one day after the plane went missing.
The plane tried to land twice before losing contact, Allamand told reporters Friday.
Two of the bodies recovered were female and two were male, government spokesman Andres Chadwick told reporters.
TVN quoted him as saying he was almost certain the plane had crashed because of the number of items recovered.

From UN.org;In 1996, the General Assembly invited Member States to observe the International Day for Tolerance on 16 November, with activities directed towards both educational establishments and the wider public (resolution 51/95 of 12 December).
This action came in the wake of the United Nations Year for Tolerance, 1995, proclaimed by the Assembly in 1993 (resolution 48/126).
(snip)From Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello, What's So Funny 'bout Peace, Love and Understanding;From the Human Rights Education Association;An International Day for Tolerance can serve as an annual occasion for tolerance education as well as for wider social and political reflection and debate on local and global problems of intolerance.

Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years.
He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP, the advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health care legislation that the drug industry opposes.
Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said.

Nato taskforce to form 'Afghan FBI' and root out high-level corruptionEarlier this month, Gordon Brown warned the Afghan president that he would lose international support if he failed to improve its performance.
Her comments reflect growing impatience among Karzai's western backers at his apparent unwillingness to tackle corruption.
Western legal officials criticise it for being toothless and not independent of the president, who appointed its senior staff.
Information gathered by Nato will then be handed over to the major crimes taskforce, a wing of Afghanistan's intelligence service but trained by the FBI and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).
Even a close colleague of Karzai said the president was "struggling to justify the unjustifiable".

Uninsured ER patients twice as likely to die - Health - Health careUninsured patients with traumatic injuries, such as car crashes, falls and gunshot wounds, were almost twice as likely to die in the hospital as similarly injured patients with health insurance, according to a troubling new study.
The study, appearing in the November issue of Archives of Surgery, comes as Congress is debating the expansion of health insurance coverage to millions more Americans.
The uninsured patients' death rate was 5.7 percent.
But hospitals can transfer patients, or send them away, once they're stabilized.
Private hospitals more likely to transfer uninsuredSome private hospitals are more likely to transfer an uninsured patient than an insured patient, said Lavonas, who wasn't involved in the new research.

College Ivy Sprouts at a Connecticut PrisonWesleyan’s Newest Admits After years of slim pickings for prisoners who craved higher education, two Wesleyan University students convinced their school to bring an elite college education to inmates at a high-security prison.
“This does not make sense to me,” he said of the Wesleyan program.
It is the place where all of Connecticut’s license plates are made, and it offers a variety of other classes beyond the Wesleyan program, though not college level.
Several students, in fact, have little prospect of ever using their college credits in a career: prison will be their home for this lifetime.

Another striking figure in the report: of the 1,702,537 drug arrests in 2008, 82.3 percent were for simple possession of a contraband substance.
According to San Francisco Weekly’s calculations, 2008 saw one marijuana arrest every 37 seconds.
According to the newly released Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report for 2008 every 18 seconds someone is arrested and charged with violating drug laws.
“Almost half of the country’s 14,000 murder victims, for example, were African-American.”The Office of National Drug Control Policy had not commented on the FBI report at time of publication.

No sooner had Michele Bachmann hijacked the Republican presidential contenders' debate to declare she is indeed a candidate for the White House than her newly minted campaign website said she is on her way to "reclaim America".
The most crucial endorsement came from the senator regarded as godfather of the movement, Jim DeMint, who said: "Bachmann does impress.

The probe appears to date from 2008, as a number of activists began planning for massive antiwar demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul.
Anti-war activist Tom Burke meets Barack Obama in 2004 at Burke's Chicago-area union hall as Obama was running for U.S. Senate.
The couple are among the grassroots activists close to the world once inhabited by Barack Obama who have been caught up in the investigation.
They say the government, using its post-9/11 focus on terrorism as a pretext, is targeting them for their political views.

New York City public schools will get door alarms to prevent what happened to Avonte OquendoNew York City is installing 21,000 audible door alarms at public schools to prevent another tragedy like the disappearance and death of an autistic student in 2013, city education officials said Thursday.
A March 2014 report released by the special commissioner of investigation for city schools found that several errors led to Avonte's death.
Principals, teachers and school safety agents also will receive additional training on managing students during transitional periods, like lunchtime when they can slip out unnoticed.
The alarms will be in place by the end of 2015, Deputy Schools Chancellor Elizabeth Rose said.
In response to Avonte's death and a handful of incidents involving students disappearing from schools, City Council members passed a bill known as Avonte's Law last year.

Ten tourists undressed and took photos, which was reported by their protesting guide, according to police.
A Malaysian official suggests the quake jolting Malaysia's Mount Kinabalu was a sign the spirits were angry after a group of Western tourists last weekend outraged locals by snapping nude photos at the summit and posting them on the Internet.
Only five have been identified by name so far.
According to Malaysian police reports, Lindsey Petersen, 23, and Danielle Petersen, 22, are two of five tourists who have been identified as disrespecting the mountain, considered a sacred place in the indigenous culture of Sabah.

Connecticut "Medical Marijuana Refugees" Will Stay in MaineWhat keeps Cyndimae Meehan's seizures at bay also keeps her in Maine as a medical marijuana refugee.
Time ran out this legislative session on a bill that would have allowed minors to be prescribed medical marijuana.
But what keeps Cyndimae's seizures at bay also keeps her in Maine as a medical marijuana refugee.
Susan's story and heartfelt testimony did a lot to bring attention to Senate Bill 1064, a proposal that would have allowed minors with certain ailments to be prescribed medical marijuana.
"We had been through 23 different anti-epileptic drugs and our neurologist basically told us we were out of options, and should look into getting her to a state where we could legally try medical marijuana," Meehan said.

Hospitals Back Providers Applying for New York State Marijuana LicensesBut the medical centers said they were not applying themselves for medical marijuana licenses.
Friday was the deadline for companies to apply to become one of up to five licensed medical marijuana producers and distributors in the state.
Those five producers would each be able to run up to four medical marijuana dispensaries in various parts of the state.
The State Health Department said on Friday that it was not yet able to release the number or names of the companies that had applied.
Licensure could also ensure that their patients would have access to the drug, since insurance companies do not cover medical marijuana.

Jury finds Los Angeles officer guilty of assaulting handcuffed womanLOS ANGELES A jury found a white Los Angeles police officer guilty on Friday of assault for kicking and shoving a handcuffed black woman who was in the back of a patrol car and later died after complaining that she could not breathe.
Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement he appreciated his partnership with prosecutors "to ensure that officers who operate outside of the law and tarnish our badge are held accountable."
O'Callaghan, 50, was taken into custody and faces up to three years in prison when she is sentenced on July 23.
"This is another step in the continued struggle to obtain full justice for her children," they said in a statement.
"What she is remorseful about was the last words Ms. Thomas heard were her (O'Callaghan's) own words and as a mother that's been weighing on her heavily," Rico said.

Al Qaeda in Yemen rebukes ISISStory highlights Al Qaeda group in Yemen rebukes ISISLeaders unhappy with al-Baghdadi caliphate plansAQAP reaffirms allegiance to head of al QaedaAl Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released Friday, declaring ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate to be illegitimate.
AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, despite being named the number two of al Qaeda globally by al-Zawahiri last year, had been careful not to weigh in publicly on the dispute between al Qaeda and ISIS, restricting himself only to a poem he released in July praising his Egyptian boss.
By then, Jabhat al Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and ISIS were already fighting each other in parts of northern Syria.
In February, the general command of al Qaeda declared it had severed ties with ISIS because of its insubordination and its brutal tactics against fellow Muslims.
And in a repudiation of al-Baghdadi's claim to supremacy among jihadis, he reaffirmed the group's pledge of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar.

None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found.

A judge in Charlotte, North Carolina, has unsealed a set of 529 court documents in hundreds of criminal cases detailing the use of a stingray, or cell-site simulator, by local police.
Neither Senior Resident Judge Richard Boner, nor the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s office, nor the Mecklenburg County Public Defender’s office immediately responded to Ars’ request for comment.
Ars has filed a public records request with the court to obtain the full set of documents.
According to the Charlotte Observer, the records seem to suggest that judges likely did not fully understand what they were authorizing.

EU Parliament Prepares Plan To Split Up GoogleA non-binding resolution that would separate Google's search engine operations in Europe from the rest of its business is being prepared by the EU Parliament.
Prompted by growing concerns among European politicians about the internet giant's dominance in the online search market, the plan is designed to curb the firm's power.
A public call for a break-up would the most far-reaching action proposed - and a significant threat to Google's business.
Parliament has no power to initiate legislation and lacks the authority to break up corporations, and while the draft motion is a non-binding resolution, it would step up the pressure on the European Commission to act against Google.
The draft motion does not mention any specific search engine by name, though Google is by far the dominant provider of such services in Europe with an estimated 90% market share.

Native Children Have the Same Rate of PTSD as Combat VeteransHere's the most sobering statistic you'll see today: American-Indian and Alaskan Native children experience PTSD at the same rate at veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Among other proposals, the committee recommends Congress grant tribes the ability to prosecute non-Indians who abuse children.
According to a new report from a Department of Justice advisory committee, 22 percent of American-Indian and Alaskan Native juveniles have PTSD—three times higher than the national rate.
Under the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress empowered tribes to prosecute non-Indians who commit domestic violence, but left other crimes, like sexual abuse, untouched.

Assisted suicide charges against Philly nurse dismissedAssisted suicide charges against Philly nurse dismissedBarbara Mancini was charged in Schuylkill County with aiding her terminally ill father's death.
Russell's decision dismissing charges Mancini broke the state law against assisted suicide brings the closely watched and controversial case to a decisive point.
Pottsville police filed a felony charge of aiding suicide, and Kane's office took the case because the county district attorney declared a conflict of interest.
After a hearing in October, Russell found the state relied too heavily on Mancini's own statements without independently establishing that the crime of aiding suicide had occurred.
Finding that a jury would have to speculate about Mancini's intent when she gave her father the medicine, Russell granted a motion by Mancini's attorney to dismiss the charge of aiding suicide.

High school outlaws yoga pants and leggings [UPDATED]A recently enforced ban on yoga pants and leggings by a high school in Rockport, Massachusetts, has some students and parents saying the policy goes too far.
Rockport High School’s dress code states that students are not to wear the offending pants however, students say the policy was not enforced until recently.
They were sent home and told to change their clothes and some received a write up, warning them not to wear the outlawed pants to school.
20 female students protested by wearing the body hugging pants on Friday.
The administration seems to disagree, saying that the ban is in place because the form fitting pants are “distracting” and not acceptable in the classroom environment.

The withholding of the radiation data looks to be the latest in a long line of missteps for the utility, experts said.
Tepco had been trying to gain the consent of local fisheries groups to discharge excess water into the sea, after promising to reduce its radiation levels.
Tepco released the data on Feb. 6 showing that the groundwater contained a record 5 million becquerels per liter of radioactive strontium-90.

How Obama Officials Cried ‘Terrorism’ to Cover Up a Paperwork ErrorAgain and again they asserted the so-called “state secrets privilege” to block the 48-year-old woman’s lawsuit, which sought only to clear her name.
“The idea that any of this poses any threat to national security is ridiculous,” Pipkin said in a telephone interview.
It’s not the first time the government pushed the envelop in declaring state secrets in litigation.
The same was true when the state secrets privilege was born in a 1953 Supreme Court case.
Instead of admitting to the error, high-ranking President Barack Obama administration officials spent years covering it up.

Court: Strippers were club employees, could be owed millionsCourt: Strippers were club employees, could be owed millionsCARSON CITY — Strippers who danced at Sapphire Gentlemen’s Club in Las Vegas were employees, not independent contractors, and entitled to be paid minimum wage, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled today.
Sapphire Gentlemen’s Club, billed as the “World’s Largest Strip Club,” maintained it merely provided a venue for the dancers — independent contractors — to perform.
The unanimous decision, authored by Justice Kristina Pickering, sends the case back to District Court to determine how much the dancers are owed.
Sapphire made investments in maintaining the club, advertising and covering other expenses, the court said.
A class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of an estimated 6,500 dancers could result in the payment of millions of dollars in back wages, according to court documents.

Iranian Book Celebrating Suicide Bombers Found in Arizona DesertPublished in Iran, it consists of short biographies of Islamic suicide bombers and other Islamic militants who died carrying out attacks.
EXCLUSIVE: A book celebrating suicide bombers has been found in the Arizona desert just north of the U.S.- Mexican border, authorities tell Fox News.
Authorities would not release a picture of the book to Fox News, or reveal how long they believe it was lying in the desert.
Agents also say that the book appears to have been exposed to weather in the desert "for at least several days or weeks."
"At this time, DHS does not have any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the Southwest border," a Department of Homeland Security official said in a statement.

First UBS, Now HSBC?Last summer, HSBC was the target of an investigation into whether its clients violated banking secrecy laws; HSBC has vigorously denied the charges.
Fresh off of victories involving UBS and Deutsche Bank related to tax fraud/tax evasion, the IRS has now targeted an “unknown British bank” for its role in a tax evasion scheme.
But the signs (including allusions to the size and location of branches) point to British based HSBC.
Other cases involving HSBC clients have also made news.
You knew that it would be just a matter of time before the IRS set its sights on a new bank.

62,000 Guns Missing from Firearm Dealer Inventories Since 2008, Report by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and ExplosivesThe agency, which has approximately 600 inspectors, performs compliance inspections at just 20 percent of the more than 60,000 U.S. retail gun dealers each year.
More than 62,000 guns disappeared from U.S. firearm dealers' inventories in the past three years without any record that they were sold, according to a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Paul Helmke, president and CEO of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which favors stricter gun control, said the findings reveal an alarming gap in oversight of gun dealers.
Federal law prohibits the ATF from requiring gun dealers to keep and report an annual inventory of their weapons.
"Missing firearms directly impact law enforcement officials' ability to reduce violent crime," said ATF assistant director for enforcement programs Arthur Herbert.

David Kato, Gay Rights Activist, Is Killed in UgandaJudith Nabakooba, a police spokeswoman, said Mr. Kato’s death did not appear to be a hate crime, though the investigation had just started.
“We should not overblow the death of one.”But that one man was considered a founding father of Uganda’s nascent gay rights movement.
As the most outspoken gay rights advocate in Uganda, a country where homophobia is so severe that Parliament is considering a bill to execute gay people, Mr. Kato had received a stream of death threats, his friends said.
“David’s death is a result of the hatred planted in Uganda by U.S. evangelicals in 2009,” Val Kalende, the chairwoman of one of Uganda’s gay rights groups, said in a statement.
Mr. Kato and a few other activists sued the paper and won.

Turkey publicizes its internal report on the flotilla debacle in response to Israel's Turkel Commission investigation report on Sunday.
Turkey released its own internal report on the incident, which blames Israel for the confrontation's deadly outcome.
The Turkish report also details what it called efforts by Israel to complicate any Turkish forensic examination.
The Turkish report said that Israel mounted a “full-fledged and pre-meditated attack” by heavily armed soldiers with live ammunition that used “excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate force … against the civilians on board,” the Turkish report said.

Man vindicated for videotaping his own traffic stop • The RegisterOn Monday, a Maryland state judge stated in no uncertain terms that the felony charge never should have been filed.
Maryland state police were wrong to arrest and charge a man for taping his own traffic stop and posting it on YouTube, a judge ruled earlier this week.
Motorcyclist Anthony Graber was charged with illegal wiretapping for recording plainclothes state trooper J.D.
The tape was shot with a conspicuous, helmet-mounted camera that captured the video and audio of the confrontation.

The day of underground bloodshed began at 8:25 a.m. as Brian Omara of Garden City was standing on the tracks between the Union Square and Third Avenue subway stops when he was struck by a Brooklyn-bound L train.
The third man was killed when he was pinned between an oncoming L train and the station platform at the Sixth Avenue station at about 10:10 p.m.

Rescuers on Sunday resumed searching the above-water section of the capsized Costa Concordia cruise liner, but choppy seas kept divers from exploring the submerged part, where officials have said there could be bodies on Jan. 22.
But survivors want considerably more than a third off another cruise.
“The company is not only going to refund everybody, but they will offer a 30% discount on future cruises if they want to stay loyal to the company,” said a spokesman for Costa Cruises, a subsidiary of industry leader Carnival Cruise Lines.

“Remember the ultimate speed limit in the Canadian economy is a little over two per cent, so we’re not that far off it,” he said.
Along with citing slumping trade with the U.S. and a debt crisis in Europe, Carney repeated his warning that Canadians are carrying too much debt, and have been for some time.
Not, obviously, from the public sector alone, but clearly a focus from the private sector,” Carney said.
There are other contingency measures that have been taken, that are being put in place that are helpful in this situation,” Carney said.

At least one letter requesting information about one of the groups bears the signature of Lois Lerner, the suspended director of the IRS Exempt Organizations department in Washington.

"She told me that her mom and dad were dead, and she had been in a plane crash, and the plane was upside down," Wilkins said.
They haven't discussed any possibilities of what brought the plane down or how Sailor survived the crash.
Sailor walked to the home of 71-year-old Larry Wilkins, who answered her knock at the door and called police.

After Taking on Whirlpool Corp., Black Activist in Small Michigan Town Set to Serve Jail Time for A Minor Offense“It’s a deal that’s hard to pass up.”“It’s a modern day lynching,” Adams, the Benton Harbor commissioner, told the Green Party of his latest conviction.
Edward Pinkney, is at the center of a broiling political dispute about how much sway the powerful Whirlpool corporation has in Benton Harbor, the poor predominantly Black town that is home to the international appliance conglomerate.
On Monday, Pinkney was sentenced to serve up to 10 years in prison.
In his defense, Pinkney says he was set up in 2006 during an attempt to recall a city commissioner.

Nuclear power is the greenest option, say top scientistsThe two co-authored a paper in the January issue of Conservation Biology outlining the scientific case of nuclear power in terms of environmental protection.
Of seven major technologies for generating electricity, nuclear power and wind energy had the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, they concluded.
And so the environmental movement and pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace should drop their opposition to the building of nuclear power stations.
"Nuclear power – being far the most compact and energy-dense of sources – could also make a major, and perhaps leading, contribution ….

America’s 2014 Murder CapitalThe increase pushes the murder rate to the third-highest rate on record, and for the second year, the rate surpasses Chicago’s.
Still, thanks in part to an ever-shrinking population, Detroit tops the nation when it comes to murder rate; at 43.4 murders per 100,000 residents, Detroit’s murder rate is 10 times that of New York City.
Twenty-two fewer people lost their lives last year—an almost 10 percent decrease—though the murder rate per capita still puts it just below Detroit and New Orleans.
Still, at a rate of roughly 40 per 100,000 residents, The Big Easy is competing with Detroit to be the nation’s murder capital.

Pedophiles Guide author arrested in ColoradoPhilip Greaves, 47, who wrote "The Pedophiles Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct," was arrested without incident in Pueblo, Colorado, about 110 miles south of Denver, according to Captain Andrew McLachlan of the Pueblo police department.
Greaves is not a registered sex offender in Colorado and was cooperative with police, McLachlan said.
Greaves was booked into the Pueblo County jail and is being held on a $15,000 bond while awaiting extradition to Florida, said Laurie Kilpatrick, spokeswoman for the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office.
DENVER A self-published author who sparked a debate over the limits of free speech with a book that police say advocates pedophilia was arrested by Florida authorities on obscenity charges at his Colorado home on Monday.
Pueblo police interviewed Greaves when the flap erupted, but found no reason to detain him at that time, McLachlan told Reuters.

CIA Station Chief Flees Pakistan To Avoid Prosecution In Drone AttacksIn a rare move, the CIA called Banks home yesterday, citing "security concerns" and saying he had received death threats, Washington officials told Associated Press.
Karim Khan, a journalist from North Waziristan, called for Banks to be charged with murder and executed.
Pakistani media reports have claimed that Banks entered the country on a business visa, and therefore does not enjoy diplomatic immunity from prosecution.
Banks is a liability to the CIA because he's likely to be called to court.

Air Force hires civilian drone pilots for combat patrols; critics question legalityThe Pentagon requires the Air Force to fly 60 combat air patrols with Predators and Reapers each day.
They operate only Reapers that provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, known as ISR, said Air Force Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command.
Contractors control two Reaper patrols a day, but the Air Force plans to expand that to 10 a day by 2019.
The company was paid more than $700 million over the last two years for those services, according to Air Force records.
For the first time, civilian pilots and crews now operate what the Air Force calls "combat air patrols," daily round-the-clock flights above areas of military operations to provide video and collect other sensitive intelligence.

New Look at Death Sentences and RaceBut Professor Phillips said that the numbers suggesting evenhandedness in seeking the death penalty did not tell the whole story.
Many experts, including some opposed to the death penalty, have said that evidence of that sort of direct discrimination is spotty and equivocal.
It found that the race of the defendant by itself plays a major role in explaining who is sentenced to death.
“To the extent Professor Phillips indicates otherwise, all we can say is that you would have to look at each individual case,” Mr. Durfee said.
Twenty-one years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that even solid statistical evidence of racial disparities in the administration of the death penalty did not offend the Constitution.

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonWASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a tough state law requiring voters to show photo identification, a decision critics say could keep some blacks, poor people and other traditional Democratic supporters from voting in the November election.
Souter said the law threatened to impose major burdens on the voting rights of tens of thousands of Indiana residents, especially the poor and the elderly.
"The effect of the loss ... will begin to be felt next week when Indiana holds its presidential primary using the voter ID law the court has just upheld," said Nathaniel Persily, an election law expert at Columbia University in New York.
The main opinion agreed with Republican supporters that the law was necessary to prevent voter fraud and safeguard public confidence in the integrity of elections.

Story updated to make clear SecurID 800 is the only SecurID device targeted in the new attack and to change "private keys" to "secret keys" in the sixth paragraph.
There's nothing in the new paper that suggests the attack works on SecurID devices other than the 800 model.
One version of the attack uses an improved variation of a technique introduced in 1998 that works against keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm.
These officials now concede that the attack can be used to access symmetric keys stored on the device.

Even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades, proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures.
The Arizona law generated immediate controversy after Brewer signed it in April 2010.
"Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law."
The federal government challenged four provisions of the Arizona law that never were enforced, pending the legal ruling.

In 2000, he set up a company that developed advanced technology for the US government, including for the Pentagon and Nasa.
Stewart Nozette, 52, was ordered to remain in custody until his trial as he was considered too great a flight risk by the magistrate.
Prosecutors alleged that he tried to give classified information to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer.
He then spent 10 years at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he designed highly advanced technology.

Obama endorses military commissions for Guantánamo detainees"The Military Commissions Act of 2009 raises serious constitutional concerns," said Virginia Sloan, president of the Constitution Project.
Obama signed the Military Commissions Act of 2009 Wednesday.
Opponents of military commissions say that the federal court system in the United States is robust enough to prosecute Al Qaeda suspects.
But the new law also authorizes military commissions to try individuals for conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism.
The Obama administration is expected to soon announce which other detainees will also face military justice through the revised commission system.

Canadian folk singer killed by coyotes, park official says(CNN) -- A rising Canadian folk singer was killed by coyotes this week in a national park in Nova Scotia, a park spokesman said Thursday.
Mitchell was recently nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by Canadian Folk Music Awards.
Bird said hikers saw the coyotes attacking Mitchell and called 911.
"Words can't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet, compassionate, vibrant, and phenomenally talented young woman," Weitz said.
Coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare, said Michael O'Brien, wildlife manager of furbearers and upland game for Nova Scotia.

Survey Shows Parents Would Rather Talk Drugs Than Science or MathWe need to help parents help their kids make the best choices, including taking math and science courses so they are prepared to succeed.
In fact, according to a recent survey conducted through the Intel Corporation, parents are more comfortable talking with their kids about drugs than about science and math.
Some key points from the survey:More than half (53 percent) of parents of teenagers admit that they have trouble helping their children with math and science homework.

Most parents, having been through primary school themselves at some point, have a difficult time with this talk.

Feds: 68 fatal ODs linked to Kan. clinic - US news - Crime & courtsHis last visit to the Schneider clinic was Jan. 3, 2008, when the clinic was struggling to stay open while the Schneiders were jailed.
"They have essentially tried to blame Dr. Schneider for any death that has happened to a patient," Williamson said.
The government alleges that from 2002 through 2007, Schneider Medical Clinic patients who died of drug overdoses accounted for 18 percent of all such deaths in Sedgwick County and surrounding areas.
A new federal indictment implicates a Kansas doctor and his wife in nine additional patient deaths, bringing to 68 the number of fatal overdoses the government contends are linked to illegal prescription writing and a moneymaking conspiracy at their clinic.
The Schneiders were arrested in December 2007 on charges they unlawfully prescribed drugs, overbilled for medical services and committed money laundering.

John C. Gaeta, 58, of Albany, said Thursday that he's glad Malvo wrote him but remains skeptical about Malvo's intentions.
Malvo wrote: "I am truly sorry for the pain I caused you and your loved ones.
"I'm glad he wrote the letter," Gaeta said.
Last month, Malvo confessed to Louisiana detectives that he shot Gaeta, but said he thought the man had died.

Dark Film on Teenagers Echoes From Mall to ChurchKatarzyna Roslaniec, a young filmmaker, first spotted a cluster of mall girls three years ago, decked out in thigh-high latex boots.
Soon, she said, she had a network of dozens of mall girls.
Mall girls interviewed here say that after choosing a benefactor, they follow him into a shop, and seduce him by trying on clothes.
At Zlote Tarasy, a sprawling mall in central Warsaw, Nina Chmielewska, 15, a high school student chomping on a Big Mac in the food court, said she knew some mall girls at school.
Ms. Roslaniec called mall girls the daughters of capitalism.

Jose Padilla lawsuit against Pentagon thrown out in USJose Padilla was seeking to sue current US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, for violating the constitution.
"The court today held that Donald Rumsfeld is above the law and Jose Padilla is beneath it," he said in a statement.
"But if the law does not protect Jose Padilla, it protects none of us, and the executive branch can simply label citizens enemies of the state and strip them of all rights, including the absolute right not to be tortured."
The court today held that Donald Rumsfeld is above the law and Jose Padilla is beneath it Ben Wizner, American Civil Liberties UnionHe was taken into custody in Chicago in May 2002 after arriving at O'Hare International Airport from Pakistan via Switzerland.

REUTERS/Saad ShalashBAGHDAD Iraq's capital wants the United States to apologize and pay $1 billion for the damage done to the city not by bombs but by blast walls and Humvees since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
The heavy blast walls have damaged sewer and water systems, pavement and parks, said Hakeem Abdul Zahra, the city spokesman.
Baghdad's neighborhoods have been sealed off by miles of concrete blast walls, transforming the city into a tangled maze that contributes to massive traffic jams.
The statement made no mention of damage caused by bombing.

After Boston, we should put Muslims under surveillance, says Rep. KingPresident Obama cautioned the nation not to rush to judgment about the Boston Marathon bombers.
Those who knew the family have said Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become a devout Muslim in the past few years.
King, who chairs the House subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, is urging authorities to beef up their surveillance of Muslims in the U.S. following Friday night’s arrest of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
Police must “realize that the threat is coming from the Muslim community and increase surveillance there,” the New York lawmaker told National Review.
But that’s not stopping Republican Rep. Peter King.

Dzhokhar apparently used cell phone to trigger bomb: FBIThe suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was charged by federal prosectors as he lay in a bed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, officials said.
A graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Emory Law School, Chakravarty is an Assistant US Attorney for Massachusetts.
During the bedside arraignment, a magistrate judge advised Tsarnaev of his rights and the charges against him, according to court papers.
He has also served in Washington DC as Assistant General Counsel at the FBI.
"He walks away without his knapsack, having left it on the ground where he had been standing," the court papers said.

Updated homeless 'bill of rights' passes CA legislative committeeAn amended version of a bill that would extend new protections to California's homeless population cleared the Assembly Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning.
The amendments addressed those concerns, Ammiano and supporters of the bill argued.
A widely derided provision establishing "the right to engage in life sustaining activities" including "urinating" was deleted.
"Today numerous laws infringe on poor peoples' ability to exist in public space, to acquire housing, employment and basic services and to equal protection under the laws," Ammiano said at a Tuesday morning hearing.
The California Chamber of Commerce included AB 5 on its annual list of "job killers" because it imposes "costly and unreasonable mandates on employers."
