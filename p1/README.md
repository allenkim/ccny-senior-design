# Group assignment of Capstone I
**Deadline: 10/19/2016**

1. (Logic reasoning)
  
   Justify the correctness of Huffman encoding algorithm: In Huffman encoding algorithm (sort the symbols in order and merge the top two symbols iteratively until only one node is left), prove that for two symbols A and B with probabilities p(A)    >= p(B), then in the resultant representation sequence according to Huffman encoding procedure, the length of symbol A is    no longer than that of symbol B.

2. (Algorithm design and complexity analysis)

   For a square N x N matrix A, assume the elements are sorted in ascending order along the horizontal and vertical      directions already, i.e., A[i][k] ≤ A[j][k] and A[k][i] ≤ A[k][j], where i<j. Develop an efficient algorithm to search for the query value v from A, return the location if found, None otherwise. Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.

3. (Double-blind testing)
  
   Use double-blind testing method to evaluate the performances of three search engines that you are free to choose.

### Performance evaluations:
1. A mini-presentation of your answers during 10/19 class, graded by all other groups.
2. Make your solution folder available in your GIT repo on 10/19.
